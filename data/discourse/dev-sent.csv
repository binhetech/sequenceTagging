In my point of view , I agree with parents should let children make mistakes and let them from their own mistakes .	B_I0
First of all , I think we are all different person.	I_I0
One words cannot talked with everyone .	I_I0
Long times ago,a mother had a children.	I_I0
The children named Jack,he was very fleshless.	I_I0
And his good friend named Tom was tarnal fat.	I_I0
When they played together,Jack's mom usually told him to ate more foods.	I_I0
Tom's mom looked at this ,also told to Tom that he should ate more than Jack.	I_I0
Ten years ago,Tom was weight for 110KG .	I_I0
Becasuse his obesity,he was dead.	E_I0
Jack was very thin,so his mother told him to ate more to add some nutrition.	S_M0
But Jack was very fat ,he can't ate more .	B_S0
This is the differences from their two persons.	I_S0
All of people like this.	I_S0
So,parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.	E_S0
Secondly, If you think about your children cannot get mistakes ,you are wrong.	S_M0
Failure is the mother of success.	B_S0
If your children make mistakes,it was normally.	I_S0
Washington,the leader of USA.	I_S0
When he was young,he cutted down a tree which belong to his father.	I_S0
He was very nervous that time.	E_S0
After that day,he had never get a good rest.	S_M0
Finally,he told hs father that he cutted down the tree.	B_S0
His father never hitted him,bug give him a large hug.	I_S0
And said:"Oh, my boy!	I_S0
You can find out your mistake and told to me.	I_S0
It was very surprise.	I_S0
I love you."	I_S0
When he grow up ,he became the leader of USA.	E_S0
So,I think parents should et children make mistakes and let them lrarn from their own mistakes.	S_C2
 
Recently the issue of weather parents off their children mony for each high grade they get in school has brought into foucus on public attention, different people hold different views, some people take it for granted that.	B_I0
However, other people think parent shouldn't give a lot of money to child.	E_I0
For me, I don't think it's a good idea.	S_T0
First of all, with the rapid development of socity, people's idea have changed.	S_M0
People treat enducation much more important, some parents create some new methods encourage their children to be enthusiastic about learning.	B_S0
So many parents offer money to their children.	I_S0
But I think that will changed children's thinking for money, and they will think only money is purpose to study.	I_S0
For example, my aunt always give a lot of money to her son, which is hoped her child will get good results in every exam.	I_S0
But on one occasion, his son didn't do well in the exam, so my aunt don't give money to her son.	I_S0
Then my aunt had a conflict with her son.	I_S0
Later, as long as my aunt didn't give her son money, her son wouldn't study hard.	E_S0
The second reason is that school-age children are young, they don't have the ability to control themselves and to tell things right and wrong.	S_M0
If they have many money, they mightl use this money to buy some novel that indendent of learning or they might to use this money to play computer games.	B_S0
That isn't bebefit for their study, and make kids addicted to the internet.	I_S0
If children are addicted to the internet, they will don't like study.	E_S0
Admittedly, monye could encourage children to get hidgt grade in some way, but with the long time, the child my develop a bad habit that is lavish money.	S_M0
So  I think parent should give a lot of money to their children.	S_S2
All in all, I think parent should give a lot of money to their children.	B_C1
because that will changed children's thinking for money, and they will think only money is purpose to study and effect children's study.	E_C1
 
Nowadays,it's very common that some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.	S_I0
Because these parents believe that their children have the rights and the abilities to buy what they want through their efforts.	S_T0
And as we all konw,high grade is very important for chilren.	S_T1
Their life quality will depend on it.	S_T0
There is no doubt that money will encourage children to study hard and get high grade.	S_T1
But as far as I am concerned,it's not beneficial to give children money for each high grade they get in school.	S_T0
The followings are my reasons.	S_S2
First of all,school-age children are not old enough to have adequate ability to understand how to use their money.	S_M1
It's likely for them to use money in a wrong way.	B_S0
For example,many children will use money to buy their equipment in the computer games.	I_S0
As time goes by,they will be more addicted in playing computer games and they won't spend too much time on their study.	E_S0
Second,it's not beneficial for children to earn and save their money in the future.	S_M1
Because they don't understand th	O
 
With the improvement of society, modern people become creative so that people's dream become variety.	B_I0
A controverstial topic arouses a debate: whether people should follow the ambitious dream or focus on achieving realistc goals.	I_I0
Some people think realistic goals is more practical.	I_I0
however I hold the view that people should chase the ambitious dream.	E_I0
My view can be illustrated as follows.	S_T0
First, ambitious dream will motivate people work hard and keep going.	S_M1
With the ambitious dream, people can easily see the distance between the reality and the dream so that they will work hard  to shorten the distance.	B_S0
Even if the ambitious dream dream is hard to come true, it will encourage people keep doing to achieve it.	I_S0
But the realistic goals are less hard than ambitious dream, it can not stimulate people foucs the goal for a long term.	I_S0
For example, Ma Yun, the CEO of Alibaba, wants to no hard business in the world.	I_S0
With this dream, he keep working above 20 years, he work about 14 hours per day.	I_S0
Eventually, his conpany linked large number of product makers and sellers.	E_S0
Second, ambitious dream will bring people creative insights.	S_M1
People will not be limited in the short-term goals, they can expect the unlimited possibility of future and make preparation.	B_S0
If people just want to achieve the realistic goal, they have less chance to prepare for future.	I_S0
For example, my uncle wants to change the unconvenient traffic method in ten years ago.	I_S0
Later, with this dream, he know much about the mobile internet and become a programer when he enter the university, and his dream motivate him join in the Uber which supply taxi service for people.	E_S0
In conclusion, people should chasing the ambitious dream rather than the realistic goals.	S_C2
Not only because people will work hard and keep going	O
 
Nowadays, with the competations in the society gradually increase, children are forced by their parents to learn as much  skills and knowledge as possible and thus under great pressure.	S_I0
Some people consider that students should more time on doing homework or participating in orgazed activities related to school or sports instead of doing something they really interested in.	B_T1
Personally speaking, I firmly disagree with the idea and my viewpoint is based on the following reasons and examples.	E_T1
First, studying all day long without any entertainment may reduce the efficiency of study.	S_M1
Just as the old saying goes, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.	B_S0
There is no doubt that studying hard is beneficial for students.	I_S0
However, if they cannot relax during heavy work, it is possible that even it seems that they are learing, they cannot concentrate on what they are reading and actually learn nothing.	I_S0
Take my classmate in high school as an example.	I_S0
His family was poor so he tried his best to work hard.	I_S0
I could always see him with a book, even when he was walking.	I_S0
In spite of all the hard work, his grades were poor and did not pass the college entrance exam.	E_S0
In addition, participating in activites that children are really interested in can provide students with another way to success.	S_M1
In the future, students may be cannot find a job related to their major and their interests will give them a second chance to find a decent job.	B_S0
For example, my uncle, who majored in math in university, lost his job last year and could not find a new job.	I_S0
Nevertheless, he loving running when he was a child and practiced much.	I_S0
As a consequence, he found a job to teach children about who to run in a primary school.	E_S0
Admmittedly, spending more time on homework or organized activities is useful to students' study.	S_C2
With more time to learn	O
 
At present, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debete among students: will people spend less time cooking and preparing food in twenty years than they do today.	B_I0
Answers vary one from another.	I_I0
Some people claim that people will spend more time on the preparation of the food and meal for people gradually increase their awareness of the value of  life quality.	I_I0
Contrary to their opnions comes to my own perspective that the time spent in cooking and preparing foods will decrease in twenty years.	E_I0
My viewpoint is based on the following points.	S_T1
First, more advanced technology will appear and replace human work to cook, which will shorten the time human spends on cooking.	S_M1
To be more specific, with the twenty-year development of technology, it is more likely that people can invent some new machines to help them cook.	B_S0
And as we know, the efficiency of machines is usually faster than human work, which will largely shorten the time people stay in the kitchen.	I_S0
For example, as I know, there is a kind of mechine used in the kitchen nowadays.	I_S0
what people only need to do to this machine is to pour the ingredients into the container of the machine and then click some bottoms and the machine will work automatically.	I_S0
It could fry, stir, steam and so on.	I_S0
Finnally, people will attain delicious dishes from this machine.	I_S0
That's the technology appearing nowadays.	I_S0
So we can predict that there must be more advanced machine coming out in the future and the time human spend in the kitchen will decrease furthur.	E_S0
Second, people will spend more time on their work rather than cooking for the life pace is faster and faster.	S_M1
Specifically, with the development of the society, to follow the step of the society people are facing much more pressure from life and work than before.	B_S0
Under this circumstance, people will reduce time spent on other less important things than their work such as time spent on road, cooking, eating and even sleeping.	I_S0
For example, my uncle work in Beijing and face a serious situation that he must work so hard that he could survive in this city which is well-known for its fast life pace.	I_S0
So he usually hust eats bread for lunch and dinner to shorten the time of the "unnecessary things".	I_S0
As we imagine, people in 2018 have faced so much pressure.	I_S0
What if people in 2038 faced the same situation?	I_S0
They certainly spen	E_S0
In conclusion, people will spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do mowadays.	S_C2
 
I do agree with the statement,because we all know that making mistakes are something unavoiable during the development of a child.	B_T0
And learning the results or the solutions of a mistake is significant to a child's behavior.	E_T0
Just take an example,once a child is putting a glass bottle at the edge of the table where would be easily for it to drop,we don't need to call the kid back to put it again.	B_S1
If the glass bottle is accidently hitted by the kid's arm,it break into pieces in the kid's sight(just be cautions in case that the child get hurt if he picks them up),then he will know the consequence of what he did before.	E_S1
The reason why we don't need to stop children is also include that the different types of memory lasts differently in time.	S_M1
Assume that we stop children,what they learn is just the words'you can't do this'or something else which will not become solid in their mind,and as a result,we need to tell them once and once again.	B_S0
But what if we let them know themselves in the visual perspective?	I_S0
they will become a unforgettable thing in their memory,because we all know that we can memorize the pictures more rapidly then words and it will lasts longer,too,as we will better memorize a poem if we can form a series of pictures of the poem.	E_S0
A good saying goes that:'Great works are from failures'.	S_M1
In a word,we are ought to make children follow their stages of development which they need to correct the behaviors,learn the forbidden actions and to fit in the society.	B_S1
Like I said at the beginning,children's making mistakes is common and natural,we should not interrupt it.	E_S1
 
I think it is a good idea.	B_T1
In fact,in China,school-age children usually don't have enough time and ability to make money for themselves.	I_T1
They have to study even in their vacation.	E_T1
They can't stop learning because the pressure of social competition.	B_S1
All of them try their best just because they don't want left behind by others.	E_S1
Otherwise,their parents don't allow their children being left behind and don't need their children pay for tuition.	S_M2
So,it's a good idea in China.	B_S0
But,as the development of society,people's thought are changing.	I_S0
More and more parents regard as important on their children's comprehensive abilities.	E_S0
 
Nowadays, many parents tend to award their school-age children money for their high grade, and most students are willing to receive these extra money from theri parents.	B_T1
Although it is understandably for parents to get well-proformed children rewerded, I consider it not a good idea.	E_T1
Firstly, children, lack of the ability of self-controlling, may cheat in the examation in order to get the money instead of working.	S_M1
Obviously, parents intend to encourage their children to work hard and get high grade in school, but from students' aspect, what they really concern is grade.	B_S0
Once they find that they can gain high mark by chatting rather than hardworking, it not hard to imagine which way they choose.	I_S0
For example, my father promised to buy me a toy car if I aced in the final test of grade 2.	I_S0
In order to fulfilled my dream of owning a toy car, I tried my best in perparing for the test.	I_S0
Not confident as I was, I finally deceided to wrote the point on a tiny paper instead of remembering it.	I_S0
That was excatly cheating but I did not realize at that age.	E_S0
Secondly, if students get used to receive money from parents, the money itself may gradually become the motivation of their study, which makes it hard for them to realize the importance of study.	S_M1
And once they grow up, they may find themselves are less enthusiastic in study, which is vital in this demanding soecity.	B_S0
For instance, it is not rare to find a lot of students are satisified with what they learn in university class.	I_S0
Never getting access to library to search some knowledge is widely accepted by them.	I_S0
This phenomenon indicates that students show less passion on self-stduy.	I_S0
From my perspective, parents award with them money instead of letting them know the importance is account for these phenomena.	E_S0
All listed above come together to show my view point that awarding them money	O

Recently, and interesting question has aroused a heated debate among people: it is better for people to follow their dreams even if the dreams are ambitious than focus on achieving realistic goals.	S_T0
Answers vary from person to person.	S_T1
Some claim that people should follow their own dream even if it is so ambitious.	B_T0
However, I stand on the opposite site and I firmly believe that it is good for people to focus on achieving realistic goals.	E_T0
Some reasons and examples given below can illustrate my point of view.	S_T1
First, the realistic goal is more easy to achieve.	S_M1
As we all know, every one have their own dream and want to achieve it.	B_S0
What makes dream easy to achieve is the clear project and the available goal.	I_S0
Which means they need to make the dream become a realistic goal and do some project to achieve it.	I_S0
On the contrary, if the people just have a big dream without any available way to get the dream, it is just a imagination and the people would never achieve it.	I_S0
For example, I want to finish a 10 miles marathon after 3 month.	I_S0
So I make some plan to help me achieve it-- training my running ability every morning that running 3 miles near the Hou lake. l follow my project and finish every day training work.	I_S0
Finally I run the marathon and won a price.	E_S0
Second, the realistic goal is more easy to get other's help.	S_M1
People cannot achieve their goal without contact anyone, which means people would get help from other people in many times.	B_S0
If they want to achieve their dream, the realistic one is more easy to get help than the ambitious one, because the realistc one is more easy to let people understand your idea and to do the relatively help.	I_S0
For example, I and my sister all have the same dream about the art when we are children, I told my I want to become a famous artist and I want to lern how to drawing, so that my mother takes me to the training school to practic painting and always takes me to the gallery to watch the master's painting.	I_S0
But my sister just tol her mother she want to become the best artist in the world, her mother thought she's joking and not to do anything.	I_S0
Finally, I am admitted to the Qinghua art school and continue my painting learning， but my sister just forget her dream.	E_S0
To put it into the nutshell.	S_C2

With the development of the society, it becomes more demanding for people to find their right positions in this society.	B_I0
Whenever asked about whether the rules that societies today expect young people to follow are too strict, people usually exhibit an air of unccertainty.	E_I0
Anyway, I don't think the rules that young people are expected to follow today are too strict.	S_T1
To begin with, the societies now are more free than societies in the past, so the rules that set for young people are more reasonable, which are not too strict.	S_M0
Today people's attitude toward the world is more open, and they also have learned that everyone should be treated in the same way, no matter what the sex or age of the person is.	B_S0
So rules for young people and elder people are almost the same.	I_S0
If the rules for the elder people are no too strcit, then it is not too strict for young people as well.	I_S0
What's more, societies can understand young people more now, so they will try to think in young people's perspectives.	I_S0
In this way, the rules young people are expected to follow are not too strict.	E_S0
Then, young people can be exposed to more rules when they are in school, so they are already used to obey and follow those rule.	S_M0
Nowadays, young people have learned a lot of rules that they should follow in school and in society.	B_S0
And they are trained to do so almost everyday.	I_S0
Take sister's experience as an example.	I_S0
When my sister studied in shcool, she was asked to wear school uniform everyday, and she could not be late for school as well.	I_S0
After being asked to do so since she was in primary shcool, she has already formed the habbit to do so.	I_S0
So she said it's not a big deal to follow such rules, because she is used to them.	I_S0
Since young people may already be used to the rules they are expected to follow and obey, then those rules are not too strict.	E_S0
Last but nor the least, I agree that the rules young people are expected to follow and obey nowadays are stricter because the society is becoming better and better, which means there are more demand for young people.	S_M0
However, I don't think those rules are way too strict, because young people are becoming better and better simultaneously with the society because of the constraint of those rules.	B_S0
If the rules are too strict to follow then it will have bad effects, but all I can see is positive results.	I_S0
How can people say rules that lead people to improve themselves are too strict?	E_S0
To conclude, the rules for young people to follow today are stricter, but they are still posible to obey and may have positive results.	B_C1
So those rules are not too strict.	E_C1
 
The way that shows parents's love  Yes,I do .	S_I0
I think it is a good idea.	B_T1
First .	I_T1
On the one hand,it will encourage students to get higher grades,it is useful to strengthen oue confidience and the firm determination to study.	I_T1
Second, not only does parents just give the children money, but also it is a symbol of parents' love and glory  through their childen's achievement.	E_T1
besides, chidlren will understand their parents' selfless love with themselves,it also a good method to consolidate the relationship between children and parent.	B_S0
At last I want yo use a example of myself, When I got to college ,my parents always used this way to show their support to me.last month, I participated in a Speaking speech,when I passed the preliminary contest,my parents were so delighted that they provided me some money,because they wanted to strengthen my self-confidence .	I_S0
Also they were worried my body.	I_S0
On account of the stress which was from the contest,I  was exhausted.	I_S0
Neverthless my home is far from the school.	I_S0
so they gave me money and told me to buy some nutritious food to restore my body.	I_S0
I was appreciated to their action.	I_S0
I certainly realized their concern to me.	E_S0
As the saying goes " Parents's love is a great flame."	S_M2
They give us everything in order to support our life.	B_S1
Therefore I think the way that parents offer their childern money for each high grade they get in school is corrcet.	E_S1
 
Doing the similar tasks makes some works feel unsatsified however they are interested in doing various types of works in the work day.	B_I0
Would you really think that you can improve your work skills by doing different tasks in a day?	I_I0
Do you have enough energy do figure out what exact your work is and how you can do it better?	E_I0
In my personal view it is better for worker s to concentrate one work in the workday so that they can be distinguished as experts.	S_T0
Geting involved in one certain work helps people have deep understanding of what they are doing.	S_M1
If works can spend all of their energy into ony work which means they are more likely to be an expert in the future because of extreme concentration which is welcomed by companies.	B_S1
Setting dancers for example,if one person wants to be a ballet dancer,it will take that person's several decades to be an professional ballet dancer and what makes a perfect ballet dancer is that constant practice on the same action which a ballet dancer needs thousands of reapting to make it looks beautiful.	E_S1
Doing the same work for a longtime means a person's persistence.	S_M1
he or she does what they beloved and stick to it.	B_S0
Some works want to do different works simply because they encounter difficulties and they escape by doing another kind of work.	I_S0
This kind behviour does exist and no companys want to hire those people who always change their mind.	I_S0
Nowadays many graduates want to seek an ideal job,once they getting,they want to change their mind.	I_S0
And they will say i am not suitable for that work and i can do better in different kind work.	E_S0
In a word i think people can get promoted if they focus on what they do in both mentally and physically.	B_C0
What I mean is that companies are willing to hire those people who are looking forward to have a deep understanding about what they do and they can be regarded to be experienced.	I_C0
Moreover workers can get a sense of achievement when they specialize what they do.	E_C0
 
In such a abundant and modern society, there is an increasing number of business will challenge us.	B_I0
And Nowadays, people pay more attention to a problem that whether workers are more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do during the workday than when they do similar tasks all day long, and this generate a drastic debate.	I_I0
Some holds that just doing one work is enough for us and it also allow us to be mor e familiar to this kind of work.	E_I0
But however, in my opinion, I would like to choose to do some different types of works instead of just doing one boring work.	S_T0
And my reasons are given below.	S_T1
Firstly and foremost, doing mutiple works enable us to become more 'multifunctional' and to have more ways to survive in this variable world.	S_M1
For instance, I have a brother, Jimmy, who has just graduated from the college.	B_S0
But he has already changed many excellent company because of his extensive talents and hobbies, so he can just pick whatever company he like, while he feels satisfied.	I_S0
The reason that why he has so many talents and hobbies is that he always do all kinds of part-time jobs, this cultivated him to be a 'multifunctional' person.	I_S0
So, in order to survive in this complex world satifiedly, we had better to have many different types of tasks to do in the same time as others doing one work.	E_S0
Moreover, doing work in such way would not allow us to have a sense of bore and we would not be tedious.	S_M1
I believe all of us should know that if prople only do one simple task for a long time, it is not hard for us to becoome tried or even sleeply osmetimes, and we can easily get to hate the work.	B_S0
If we could just have many different types of tasks to do in the same time, it could be better for us to be satified and interested in what we are doing.	I_S0
Above these, we could know why we should do various work in such a time.	E_S0
So if you want to be satis	S_S2
 
Since society grows rapidly with the process of information explotion, the competetion between students are also getting much more severe than ever before, because of which parents tend to use varied ways to encourage thier children to study.	B_T0
One way, which is quirte contravertial, is that they would offer thier school age children money as a reward every time they manage to get high grade.	E_T0
From my perspective, I don't agree to this so-called award to stimulate their children's passion of studying.	S_T1
My reasons are as follows.	S_T0
First and foremost, money, as a rewarding, is not appropriate for the shape of children's value, especially when they are still in youth.	S_M1
We want to encourage children to study hard, not just for the reason that we want them to find a better job and lead a better life in the future, matierally speaking.	B_S0
What's more important is that we want them to stay curious and passionate for this world and always ready to chase for the dream they are desperately in want of.	I_S0
And if money become a reward for high mark, it will make them feel that money is the very thing that they are in chase of, who will no longer persue the dream they truely love.	E_S0
Whats more, this reward may cultivate their bad study habbit.	S_M1
If they know that they will get money as long as they get a good grade, they might just do whatever they can for a high grade.	B_S0
To think deeply seems to be an unnecessary thing.	I_S0
As far as I am concerned, there are a lot of subjects I learned at school were not that tough to get a high mark if you worked hard enough to understand what the teacher taught in the class.	I_S0
But as is widely acknoledged, we also need to cultivate a habit of critical thinking as we study, which will not be inspired by this kind of reward.	E_S0
To draw a conclusion, despite the fact that money can indeed spur children work hard to get a high grade, it's not beneficial both to their value and to the cultivation of thier cri	O
 
With the development of science in current society, people nowadays are able to keep in touch with their friends and stay connected during their work, no longer being afraid of missing out.	B_I0
Thus it results in that our daily lives are surrounded by information we need to deal with.	I_I0
Some people may agree that we shouldn't worry about our schedual since parents at home or superiors at work will help us to arrange our time reasonably.	E_I0
However, I think it improtant for ourselves to obtian the ability to plan and organize.	S_T0
Firstly, young people today usually have much confidence in themselves so they may prefer to orgnaize their lives on their own.	S_M1
Since there they are familiar with applications stalled in the cell phone, they can take advantage of it in order to arrange their  What's morever, as it's mentioned in the question, modern life has become more and more complex.	B_S0
If young people don't have the ability to arrange their time, they will find hard to compete with others.	I_S0
For example, my brother was used to rely on his parents to plan things for him.	I_S0
After he graguated from high school, he went to another city for further education.	I_S0
But, when he started his life in university, he met many obstcles such as being late for the class or forgetting the club activity ect.	I_S0
Those wouldn't be problems with his parents accompany.	I_S0
So eventually it made him to realize that he should change and become capable to make his own schedual.	E_S0
Finally, if one has difficuties to arrange their time, he can also turn to teachers or parents for aid.	S_M1
Since elder people have been equipped themselves with a lot of experiences on how to make plans or organize their lives, they can provide him accurate opinions on time-table.	B_S1
Morever, they may guide him in person by showing their life schedual to them.	E_S1
 
As an old sayiing goes , " No one makes perfect", and every one is possible to make countless mistakes during their whole life, especially the children.	S_I0
Thus, I strongly advocate that parents should allow their chirdren make mistakes and learn a lesson from those mistakes.	S_T1
To begin with, mistakes can enable children to be more experienced.	S_M0
as we all know, practice makes perfect, only by suffering tones of mistakes can make children learn a lesson from their failure and become more skillful.	B_S0
To illustrateb this, I would like to take my own experience as example: When I was a child , I usually help my mother washing dishes after meal, most of the time I often broke the bowl.	I_S0
My mother always encouraged me to learn a lesson from it and never blamed me.	I_S0
Day by day, I become more and more skillful and never break any bowls or dishes again.	E_S0
What is more, children as they are, their hearts are soft anfd easy-hurt.	S_M0
As a result, we cannot emphasize the significance of praise and encouragement too much.	B_S0
Like a young boy, while learning how to ride a bike, breaking the chains suddenly.	I_S0
Suppose at this time, his parents blame him for his negligence instead of comfort him, extreme depression will soon fill up the boy's heart.	I_S0
The next time when he sees a bike, in all probably, he may retreat from it, resulting from his annoyed parents.	E_S0
Plus, some mistakes, anyway, are ranging from lying to fighting even robbing should be avoid, owing to that they might make the situation leads to worse,.	S_M0
Permitting the mistakes occurence without violating basic regulations is what we are supposed to do.	S_S2
In conclution, parents should allow children to make mistakes within moral principles, for the reason either for their innocence and fragility.	S_C2
 
Recently, a controvesial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether young people nowadays are more likely to spend time and efforts in improving the world than young people in the past?	B_I0
Opinion vary from person to person.	E_I0
Some people claim that they think so.	B_T1
However, I would satnd on their opposite side and I believe that young people today are less likely to spend their time or efforts in improving the world than young people in the past.	I_T1
My viewpoint can be elaborated as follow.	E_T1
First, young people today are more concentrated on their own development than young people in the past.	S_M1
Nowadays, the pressure of competition become bigger and bigger, the society require young people have enough ability to adapt.	B_S0
As a result, young people today will be more focus on their own development becasue once they do not focus on their own development of life, they would be easily ignored.	I_S0
As for young people in the past, they have enough time and energy to improve the world because they do not need to face the competitive society and do not have such high pressure.	I_S0
For example, when I was in high school, I needed to spend at least one third of a day in school.	I_S0
After school, I also had to took part in the math courses.	I_S0
I felt so nervous and tired that I had no more patience to think about improving the world.	I_S0
However,  in the past, young people have more time because they have less pressure from society.	I_S0
So they will have more energy to build their homeland and peotect it.	E_S0
Second, the environment that young people live is more peaceful than young people live in the past.	S_M1
Today the world is full of peace and the people from every country are very friendly.	B_S0
However, the wars spread out the every corner of the world in the past.	I_S0
For example, China today is built very well and young people who live in China are very safe and don't need to think about the problem of improving the world.	I_S0
However, during the 1940s there were thousands of young people in China joined in the army to protect their homeland from Japan.	E_S0
All in all, I firmly think young people today are less likely to spend their wom time or efforts in improving the world than young people in the past.	S_C2
 
Living in such a booming information age, we must be prepared for constantly an army of news floating towards us.	S_T0
And there occurs a debate whether governments should put emphasis on internent or public transportation improveent, both deserves high attention, but there is only one choice, I will, from where I stand, pick the internet access at the primal place.	S_T1
And I will voice several reasons below.	S_T0
Firstly, now that the wifi recovers almost every corner of the world where people exists as well as computer and various medias spring up like the mushrooms, having access to the internet is just a piece of work, and thus developing into an essense in our daily life.	S_M0
Everyone would spend some time indulging themselves into this rich, mysterious world, escaping from the endless paper or extremely heavy work pressure and relaxing themselves.	S_S2
Secondly, with the aid of internet, people can view whatever they want and know a wide range of interesting or international news without going out, which contributes to their keeping pace with the fast-pace society, broadening their horizon and avoiding isolation,which may lead to depression.	B_M0
Thirdly, no doubt the future trend is now toughly dominated by the internet, meetings, ways pf education like homeschooling, even wars will all conducted under the operation of the internet, which also serves as the symbol of the development level of a country.	I_M0
So, it is if great necessity to boost internet with no effor left, however, that doesn't mean the halt of the public transportaion, all we see and learn on the internet, should be applied to the reality, the public transportation lays the solid foundation for our practice.	E_M0
And travelling, hiking, socilaizing are all based on the public transportation, if we live in a world with rich internet source but limited traffic access, then a large amount of the wealth we recieved from the internet will be useless because it is hard to apply without a complete transportation system.	S_S2
In a netshell, internet canbe the primary one deserving deeper development than the public transportation, which, to some extent, will lift our living standard and eyesight significantly.	B_C1
How meaningful and important it is!	E_C1
 
Nowadays, more and more famlies have only one child,which leads to the phenomenon of spliting children.	B_I0
At the same time, the expactation on children being successful becomes increasingly desperate.	E_I0
Many parents can not accept any mistake made by their children.	S_T0
however, I agree with the oponion that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes, which not only benefits children them selves, but also contribute to the development of the whole society.	S_T1
First of all, letting children make mistakes and learning from them is a necessary process of their whole life.	S_M2
As the saying goes, "if a boy never did anything wrong, he would never  be a man."	B_S0
For instance, when i was a child, my mother always let me complete school tasks by myself.	I_S0
While my classmates' parents check their assingment carefully, my mother seemed like not care about that.	I_S0
As a result , my classmates always did a good job and got compliment from teachers, while i had to be criticized and corrected the mistakes again and again by myself.	I_S0
When i was a kid, i never understood why my mother chose to do that.	I_S0
However, when i grow up, i awared that it is my mother that fostered my ability of independence.	I_S0
No matter what you do , be caucious and learn from mistakes by heart is the benefits my mother brought to me.	E_S0
Secondly, making mistake and correcting by their own efforts play  an important role in the soci	O
 
Today, education is a key topic , many parents think that will not be able to give their children money , but i think the appropriate to give children money is a good ides, here are my reasons and examples.	S_T0
First, give children monry to teach children about money management skills, children in school can be a lot of habit , parents give their chilren money to let children manage their money.	S_M0
For example, my childhood parents each week to give me some pocket money for my own use ,i used to buy some book or stationery.	S_S2
second, can let the child learn to independence.	S_M0
when the children will use money to buy what they need is a kind of independence.	B_S1
Foe example , when i was a child i need their parents will give me directly, then began to give me some pocket money to buy myself, at first i was at a loss to don,t koow what to buy but then get used to have a clear goal.	E_S1
Don't give children money can avoid a lot of harm, but we can be just the right amount of money to children and gives money to children, I think don't porgram	S_M0
we should give money to children, i think this a good idea, it can make childen get	O
 
At present, people are all chasing the sense of freshness on life or work.	B_I0
Some people prefer to do similar tasks all day.	I_I0
Because they thinks that doing well one task can make them feel the sense of achievemnet.	E_I0
Others would like to have many different types of assignments to do during the workday as different tasks is beneficial for the job and even health.	S_T0
As far as I am concerned that diverstified missions facilitate people to do well and make them happy.	S_S2
Above all, the various tasks can promote the efficiency of job.	S_M1
For exmple, my dad always sits in the office to handle the files all day.	B_S0
So he often feel bored about what he does.	I_S0
His boss, consequently, criticize him.	I_S0
However my mom is a saleswoman who always faces to the children.	I_S0
She not only sell the courses for the children, but also play with childs and teach them sing and dance.	I_S0
So she is popular with children's parents which means she has a high sale.	I_S0
Her employer  reward her many times.	I_S0
Therefore, most of workers are more satisfied with different types of tasks rather than univocal job.	E_S0
What's more, amount of assignments benefit people's mental health.	S_M1
For instance, my classmate is an engineer who need to supervise same production line every day.	B_S0
He often feel the job he complete is vain.	I_S0
After that, he is depressed about doing this job, which lead to a mental sickness.	E_S0
So it's important for the workers to do the different tasks to assure them	O
 
Recently, an interesting topic has aroused a heated debate among public: whether being creative rather than planning carefully will solve a problem.	B_T1
The answer vary from person to person.	E_T1
Some people support that planning carefully makes the best solution.	B_T0
However, I stand on the opposit position and I believe that being creative can make solve problems possible.	E_T0
Firstly, in the business field being creative is helpful to come up a new product which can move our society forward.	S_M1
As we know, once a new product is produced by a company on the market, in a short time other companies always copy the product or create resemble products.	B_S0
In this case, the market would be fulfilled with many products with same function, which makes cosumers feel boring and our society can not move on.	I_S0
Only when a totally new product is come up to the market, buyers are more likely to be caught attention and the new product may change our idea and move our society forward.	I_S0
For example, before smart phone being come up, the phone market is full of the phone with blunt keyboard.	I_S0
The creater of smart phone, Jobs, found these phones were too inconvienent and he put forward a novel phone that does not have keyboard and much lighter than before.	I_S0
Therefore, without the new idea fromJobs, we cannot have simple and convienent life today.	E_S0
Furthermore, in a acdamic compeition, a creative idea makes win the prize possible.	S_M1
This is because many participaters would search for the idea that has already win the compeition and they imitate these idea in order to win.	B_S0
However, the professors who are charge for the compeition are willing to see some new idea rather than the old ones.	I_S0
Therefore, the creative concept tend to catch professor attention and win the prize.	I_S0
For example, last year I took participate in  competition that dedicate to find way to save energy.	I_S0
Most teams conducted their project from the perspecitve that how to save fuel in the car.	I_S0
However, our team decided to deal with whether other material can replace fuel in the car.	I_S0
Eventually, our team winned the first prize because of the creative idea.	E_S0
 
In recent decades, most individuals pay increasing attention to relax.	S_I0
Groups of people reckon that doing physical exercise is better to relax than watching a movie or reading a book.	B_T0
However, personally speaking, i firmly believe that watching or reading is better to relax considering about several reasons.	E_T0
For one thing, watching a movie or reading a book to relax is more convinient.	S_M0
With the advent of modern society, more people face with stress in working, studying and life.	B_S0
Therefore, people need to relax to sweeping out stress rapidly, which is easier and more convinient by watching a movie or reading a book.	I_S0
Imaging that a person has quarral with his leader, then there's bad emotion inside him.	I_S0
When he went back home by subway or bus, the person could watch a movie or reading a book in his telephone to forget this frustation rapidly.	I_S0
However, if the person went to the gyms to doing some physical exersice for relaxing.	I_S0
It's not easier to forget stress because there's a long time to his quarral.	I_S0
Also, watching a movie or reading a book to relax could happen in break time.	I_S0
In this case, it's timely to sovle the stress.	E_S0
Another cardinal perspective is that watching a movie or reading a book is cheaper.	S_M0
It's a common phenomenon that many people often go to theater or bookbar to relax which is cheaper for the majority of people.	B_S0
Take an overview of Chinese situation in this case, there's more and more bookbars in big cities.	I_S0
Because many people have various stress in their daily life, which need a place to solve leading to bookbars existing.	I_S0
Furthuremore, in bookbars to read a book is cheaper and most people could accept the expense compared to expensive costs in gyms' physical exercise.	I_S0
So for more people, it's better to relax by reading.	E_S0
Admittedly, some people prefer to exercise in gyms to relax.	S_M0
However, this is fewer compared to watching a movie or reading a book.	B_S1
For instance, many gyms close because fewer people come to.	E_S1
In conclusion, it's better to relax by watching a movei	O
 
Nowadays, under the huge pressure of college admisson, teenages have a hard time dealing with school work.	B_I0
This always contributes to many negative behaviors of students and conflicts between parants and students.	I_I0
Therefor, some parents come up whith the idea that they actually pay their sons and daughter for doing their school work.	E_I0
And they use money as a prize for their children have high grade in classes.	B_S0
I have to admit they are uping to this for fairly good reason and good purpose.	I_S0
However, I have to say I do not support this kind of practices.	E_S0
And of course, I have convincing reasons for my opinion.	S_T0
Firstly, offering children money for their high grades has a nagetive effect on the attitude of children.	S_M2
By reciving the money, they are acceping the idea that school work is not part of their reponsibility as well, which is rediculous.	B_S0
They will grow up with a personality lacks of responsibility.	I_S0
This kind of person are claerly not welcomed in work places and teams.	I_S0
In that case, children raised up with this rule is more likely to have a tough time in their adulthood experience.	E_S0
Money aid	S_S2
 
I dissagree,it;s widely acknowledged that watching movies or doing some readings is a good way to relae, but as far as I am concerned that I perfer do some physical exercise like swimming.	S_T1
Physical exercise gains more popularity in the public.	S_M2
There are more and more gyms surrond us,which is convient for us to exercise	O
 
I think it isn't a good idea.	S_T1
There are three reasons for my idea.	B_S0
First, Stdents's studying is for themself.	I_S0
Text is only a way to inspect themself.	I_S0
Getting good grades can only tell students that he finish his tast.	I_S0
Second,I think parents give much money to there child isn't good to them.	I_S0
students don't have good consumpation view.	I_S0
They don't know how to use these money.	I_S0
And give them money may make them have bad hobby like gamble.	I_S0

Could you believe that currently our elders are still crazily enjoying celebrities's concerts of their own age at the moment?	B_I0
or Could you believe that our elders still are interested in athelets performances on weekends?	I_I0
Well, it is normal to see famous entertainers and athletes like Guoli Zhang, one of the famous actors in past decades or Yuan Wang, popular boy band idol, are popular and influential among both young people and old people regardless of the age limit.	E_I0
Hence in my opinion, the opinions of celebrities are of same weight of importance for both younger people and older people.	S_T1
Admittedly, people may claim that older people are more mature than younger people, in regard to have grown their individual ways towards life, and thus are less affected by celebrityies' opinions.	S_M1
However, maturity are not necessarily only reason that older people will consider when talking about the opinions of celebrities.	B_S0
As long as what their celebrities say are reasonable, those opinions could also modify people's traditional attitude towards certain aspects like education or civilization.	I_S0
Guoli Zhang would serve as an good example to explain this.	I_S0
Guoli Zhang is one of the out-dated popular actors and the current popular producer of a popular TV program which aims to help younger generation to get married with both young and old audiences.	I_S0
What he has said on TV, especially those opinions on how to get a successful marriage and how to be an ideal partner, is popular and serves as great role models for both younger and older citizens.	I_S0
Lots of them use Guoli Zhang's opinions as golden roles when find ideal partners for themselves as well as the next generation.	E_S0
Hence, it is understandable that opinions of celebrities, especially those with mainstream values, are respected by both the young and the elders.	S_M1
Another example is Dan Lin, one of the celebrity champions in history.	B_S1
His words encourages young and old and unites them together.	E_S1
To conclude, the opinions of celebrities can boost understanding and smooth the relationship between the young people and older people.	B_C0
As long as young people and old people have celebrity idols in common, conflicts might arouse especially for those who living together.	I_C0
Currently, generation gap has become a typical social phenomenon with the mass urbanization.	I_C0
Less young people are willing to initiatively talk with the elders.	I_C0
Thanks to the mass media, it allows those two groups share similar admirable celebrities, being easier for mutual understanding between them.	E_C0
 
With the development of technology, then it comes some quite of debates.	B_I0
Whether teachers are more valued by society in the past than teachers in nowadays?	I_I0
Can the sophisticated facilities instand of the teachers?	I_I0
As a university students, from my perspective, the teachers are less valued in the nowadays society than they were in the past.	E_I0
Since technology and era can totally decrease the significance of the teacher.	S_T1
On the one hand, the development of technology render teachers unnecessary.	S_M2
To be more convincible, in the past, we only had teachers to teached us and coached us.	B_S0
However, with the technological development, there are large amounts of sophisticated facilities likes the MP5, electronic dictionary and smart phones that can help us learning by ourselves nowadays.	I_S0
All of these products decrease the significance of the teachers, and at the same time, the cost of engaging teachers is higher than learning by the own self.	I_S0
As a result, the value of teachers in the society decline definitly.	I_S0
Take my father for instance, when he faced the college entrance examination in his learning career several decades ago, the conditions is not same as nowadays definitly.	I_S0
In his school, all students did not have their own learning rythmic, and they must remained the same pace of all the classmates in their learning.	I_S0
Meanwhile, most of the time was arranged by school and school was their center.	I_S0
There are too tired and boring.	I_S0
However, although some students do not like this learning pattern, they did not have any methods.	I_S0
Because unlike we can learning online, the students several decades ago can not learn without teacher.	I_S0
Obviously, the technology decrease the importance of teacher, than the values of teacher decline, too.	E_S0
On the other hand, the development of era enables teachers to not have significant values.	B_C1
To be more specific, unlike the society in the past, there are large numbers of college graduates in nowadays society, since the average of the education level is increased.	E_C1
As a result, the emplo	O
 
The prompt above suggests that, insteading of counting heavily on their parents to make decisions regarding their own lives, young people would be better off, should they are able to make their own choices concerning their own lives.	B_T0
From my perspective, this is a proposition that I tend to side myself with and my reasons are as follows.	E_T0
For one thing, the first step of learning to be the master of one's own fortune begins with being able to make one's own decisions.	S_M1
It is true that parents could help their children throughout the lives of their children, but what needs to be emphasized is the fact that, as time passes, these children must be on their own  when it comes to matters in their own lives in order for them to become adult themselves.	B_S0
Out of the love for PC softward, Bill Gates dropped out Harvard, against their parents' will and started Microsoft with other dreamrunners like him.	I_S0
After years of arduous efforts, the operating system Windows was out and, since then, the Microsoft empire has been one of the most successful companies the world has ever witnessed.	I_S0
Had  Gates relied heavily on his parents in the decisionmaking of dropping out Harvard, the world would more than likely fail to see the rise of Microsoft.	E_S0
For another, gaining the opportunity of having the final say in one's own decision-making would also require the young people to be as informative as he or she could, and, among all the possible information that he or she needs, adivce offered by their parents should hold a place.	S_M1
It is evident that, by getting oneself immmersed in the advice of parents, children might be overwhelmed or, worse, get themslved exasperated.	B_S0
However, the guidance or the suggestions that parents offer could also be of some help.	I_S0
The late deceased billionaire Rockefeller had offered quite a lot to not only his children but also millions of young people regarding how they could increase the chance of embracing a better future.	I_S0
While not all of those who listened and followed his advice become as successful as he is, it is more than clear-cutting that many young people would be worse off should they not follow his adivce.	E_S0
In a nutshell, it is truly paramount and hence indispensable for young people to be the master of his or her choices concering issues in their own lives.	S_C2
In the process of making such a choice,however, it is also crucial for him or her to be openminded and try to regurgitate their parents' advice.	S_S2
 
I disagree the view about it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.	B_T1
First,I think watching movie , reading a book and doing physical exercise are the same important to our health.	I_T1
The difference between them is thier specific uesd.	I_T1
If my job is sitting in the office whole day,then I perfer to doing some physical exercise,on the contary,if my job is doing many heavy work ,I perfer to watching some movie or readeing a book.	E_T1
So I think everyone all have their own choice for their reason ,we shouldn't say watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise ,they all important to our health.	S_S2
 
I think whether this idea is good or not depends on how much money parents give to their children and how parents teach their children to use money.	B_T1
In my opinion,with the development of science technology and society,school-aged children also need to get used to the changes happening around.	I_T1
They should be allowed to know what their job is and they are supposed to get some rewards for doing well in their own areas.	E_T1
Maybe you will say that there are many ways to give children rewards,but acorrding to me, the differences between children and parents lead to midunderstandings so that parents may not be able to choose things what their children really need.	B_S0
Because of this, money probably be the best thing to give their children for getting high grades.	I_S0
What's more,children also need to practice how to use their money ,also how to make plans on spending money.	I_S0
If children want to get more rewards,they will work harder to get good grades,this will encourage them to study harder.	I_S0
In this way,children will get to know how hard they work leads to how much they get.	I_S0
But,if parents give too much money to children,it will probably causes some bad things,for example,children may think they are king of "rich" and begin to use their money randomly.	E_S0
So, as what I think,parents can offer their school-aged children money for high grades they get in shool,but first parents need to teach children how to spend their money correctly,how to save money and so on.	S_C2
Children need to be  planted with a correct attitude on money,then they will be able to know how to use money for things that really make good effects on them instead of things may lead them to crime.	S_S2
 
I don't agree with that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doingphysical exercise.	B_T0
In my opinion doing exercise is the best way to relax and clear up the pressure.	E_T0
I'm a basketball fan, i can acquire a lot of fun by plangying basketball.	S_M1
While i am plangying basketball i can throw out all the anxious, the pressure, sad or some other bad emotion.	B_S0
Whenever i was in the campus i focused on the ball.	I_S0
In that time, i only tried to enjoy the game, enjoyed the exciting body impact, the sound made by ball and net and the happiness by won the game.	I_S0
So i think other sport or physical exercise will have same glamour.	I_S0
we can release ourselves by doing these exercise and be relax.	E_S0
Watching movie or reading book are only help us to forget those bad emotion but not to release them.	S_M1
They are still stay in our mind.	B_S0
When we met some troubles they may break out together.	I_S0
That was terrible.	E_S0
For me, i always play basketball to relax myself when i was anxious, having so much preesure or meeting some emotional problems.	B_C1
I feel good after i doing these.	E_C1
So i	O
 
Well， I think it is a execellent idea that parents give money to their childern when they get a high score.	S_I0
Beyond doubt,the money is encourging.	S_M0
When they receive money,they will find it good to study,and they will think they are valued by their parents and parents are paying enough attention to them .	B_S0
Provided that if a good child don't accept any award,how can they feel they are cherished?	I_S0
I was a bad student in sixth grade,when I  get 90 in my math test,and taht time I like football very very much,but I don't have money to buy a football that is the same type of my favourite football fans.	I_S0
But my father told me if I can get 95 in the final exam,I can get it.	I_S0
I was so inspired that I swear that if i must study harder than i was .	I_S0
And after 2 month I made it.	I_S0
After I get the ball,I determined to study harder and harder from then on.	E_S0
In this way,This exeprience  can be remembered by you more easily.	S_M0
If your children was given money becaues of their grades ,and after then your child get better scores,I think,you will remember it more clearly.	B_S0
And also, a visual money can become a line of momery which can make you remember this event for a lifetime.	I_S0
And a new method is found when ie is efective way to encourage your child,which you may spend a long time without this exeprience.	E_S0
But,I have to say,givng money is not perfect.	S_M0
Your child may take it for granted.	B_S0
They may be annoyed after a test without being awarded,they might shout to you because they don't know how hard to make the money.	I_S0
So,we must set a appropriate goal to encourage the child rather than the pointless award.	I_S0
In this way,your child will know how harder you work,how  many achievements you may get.	E_S0
Therefore,as far as I am concrened,the reward to your children is necessary.	B_C1
And also, it is a fantastic idea that should be done by most parents.	E_C1
 
In this day and age, Internet plays a vital role in everyday situations, so this is absolutely necessary to improve Internet access.	S_I0
However, as an indispensable part in any sphere of life, public transportation is also in great need to have improvement.	B_T0
From my point of view, it is more crucial to improve the latter one than the former one.	I_T0
My opinion will be amplified by the following reasons.	E_T0
First and foremost, improvements on public transportation allows less accidents.	S_M1
This is mainly because people will no longer drive or ride an motorcycle to work, thus leading to the decrease in accidents.	B_S0
A salient example of this can be seen in my friend's experience.	I_S0
He walked to school every day and there was a roud without traffic lights just in front of his community.	I_S0
Every day it was dangerous for him to walk through since in China the automobiles would not let the passengers go first, which was easy to get hurt.	I_S0
One day, there was a motorcycle clashing into him.	I_S0
He was hurt but he told no one.	I_S0
Finally when he got home, he told his parents that he felf painful.	I_S0
It was until then did his parents know the accident.	I_S0
As the instance reveals, if more poeple go to work or school by public transportation, there will be less people getting injured.	E_S0
In addition, it provides great benefits to the enviroment.	S_M1
This is largely due to the fact that less people drive the car, thus the exhaust gas from the car reducing.	B_S0
As a result, the enviroment in this area will be perfected in a large scale.	I_S0
For example, the time for people in a specific city to drive the cars are strictly restricted.	I_S0
If the last number of their car plate is an odd, they cannot drive the car the the day when the date is even.	I_S0
With this limit, the time people drive decreases.	I_S0
So the air in that city is fresher than the other one in this country and the river is much cleaner.	I_S0
People are even allowed to see the blue sky and beautiful birds on the tree.	I_S0
As this example demonstrates, improvements on the public transportation can lead to decrease in drive and hence a better enviroment.	E_S0
It is true, to some extent, that almost all people rely on Internet access.	B_C0
However, people can use a smart phone with more available data and stop using it for their eyes when there is no Interenet connection.	I_C0
Consequently, due to the benefits listed above, it is more crucial to improve public transportation than Internet access.	E_C0
 
Nowadays, there are some claims that university should pay more for professors to improve the quality of education.	B_I0
Admittedly, educational quality in normal universities face so many problems such as imbalanced resources, spliting between students and professors and unjustified examination.	I_I0
However, all of these problems can not be solved by spending more money on salaries for professors.	E_I0
As far as I am concered, universities can solve these by purchasing for better educatinal resources and increasing the communication between students and professors.	S_T1
Firstly, the most crutial problem of educational quality lies in imbalanced resources.	S_M1
As we all know that better universities gain lot of sponsors from government or individuals.	B_S0
With plenty of sponsors, they can not only update better equipment for teaching but also purchase various library resources like journals and professional textbooks.	I_S0
All of these contribute to cultivate elite in universities.	I_S0
However, most of universities are normal to gain huge sponsors.	I_S0
In such condition, what they should do is make full use of their money to relieve the difference in resources.	E_S0
What's more, another severe problem lies in the gap between professors and students.	S_M1
Lack of knowlegeable and emotional communication between them cause many problems.	B_S0
In the class, professors just talk about what they want to talk and they do not desire to discuss with student.	I_S0
In the condition, students lose their interests to gain more knowledge from asking professors.	I_S0
These lead to educatinal quality decrease.	I_S0
Universities can hold some lecture or parties to relieve such problems.	I_S0
In parties, they can comm	E_S0
To sum, better educational resources which contain updating teaching equipments and various library resources can provede better enviroment to studying.	B_C0
Also, deep communication between students and professors can eliminate gaps between them.	I_C0
All of these are more beneficial to improve the qualitie than just increase professors' salaries.	E_C0
 
Travel is a good way for people to relax in their spare time.	B_I0
Different peole have divided opinion on their journeies' destination.	E_I0
Some people prefer to travel abroad, while as far as I am concerned, having trips in our own country is more beneficial for us.	S_T0
My reasons and examples for this point are listed as follows.	S_T1
First and foremost, travelling in our own country enables us to save time, which is pretty favourable for us.	S_M1
That is because it can avoid us to waste too much time on our route, which wil not interfere with our daily work.	B_S0
One the contrary, if we travel abroad, we have spend much more time on the trip due to the distance.	I_S0
My own experience can be a salient example for this point.	I_S0
I am a postguate, and due to my heavy tasks in my laboratory, it is impossible for me to possess enough spare time to travel for a long distance, let along visit foreign countries.	I_S0
Thus, in my vacation, I prefer just go to several tourist spots near my citiy with my best friends to relieve my pressure.	E_S0
Moreover, travelling domesticately render us a good chance to know our own culture.	S_M1
That is because during our trips, those well-know tourist attracitons in our country will trigger us to explore the historcial stories behind them, which is a precious opportunity for us to gain the mastery of our country's history.	B_S0
I have a case to aptly illustrate my point.	I_S0
Last summer vacation, I visisted the Great Wall in Beijing, and was shocked by its specular archetecture style.	I_S0
Thus, I asked my tour guide about its function and origin.	I_S0
He told me that this building was used to defend the nomatic races living in the north of ancient China.	E_S0
I though it was fairly intriguing because I have nv	O
 
I certainly agree with this.	B_I0
Compared with the similar tasks,  giving different types of works to works has many beneficials which are really practicle.	I_I0
Just let me ask you, if you are a worker in a company, will you willing to do similar tasks all day long?	E_I0
I think most people will be satisfied when they are arranged to do colorful tasks.	S_T0
To begin with, it can raise the working effiency.	S_M1
To illustrate, my brother used to be really not good at maths, so he studied it all day long and hoped to get a good grade after exam.	B_S0
However, it turned out to be worse.	I_S0
I can tell that he was so exhausted when he studied maths during a long period, so it's not a good way to raise the effiency of studing maths.	I_S0
So i gave him a advice to work on different subjects everyday, not only studing maths.	I_S0
After tring my suggestion, he said that he was more relaxed and he could work out a big problem in maths which he never did it before.	E_S0
Secondly, it can rouse the passion in working and make workers more interested in their jobs.	S_M1
For example, my father is a project manager in his firm, and he is so busy all the time but he is always carring a smile.	B_S0
One day, i asked him why he seems so happy even he has a lot of works to do.	I_S0
He said that he would do many different works everyday and met many different poeople which made him feel excited and always ready for something new.	I_S0
I can see the postive and opsmistic mindset in him because the new challenges everyday he would meet.	E_S0
Thirdly, it can practice our other abilities in working.	B_C0
Just imagine you are an architect, and you have to design and bulid a building.	I_C0
If you only stay in the office to draw the drafts, it can't work out.	I_C0
You have to discuss with others to express your ideas and listen for others suggestions which means you need social skills.	I_C0
In addition, you need to have a practicle method to carry out your plan, which means you need to have team spirit and work with others together.	I_C0
The different tasks will make you to practice your other improtant skills when you at work.	E_C0
 
Nowadays, the entertainment industry is more and more popular, some people present a event that various celebrities are more significant to younger people than they are to elder people.	S_I0
In my opinion, celebrities are more important to yougher people actually, there are following reasons.	S_T0
First of all, younger people will be influenced by these celebrities easiely.	S_M1
Young people have lesser life experience than elder, so they cannot distinguish many notions such as whether a person is good who can gain more lovers.	B_S0
As a result, they will be easiely impacted by many celebrities, especially celebrities who have better social statues or other things they chased.	I_S0
For example, my father said that he have been influenced deeply by some entertainers who can perform Chinese Kongfu, such as Xiaolong Li, then he would fight with his classmates or smoked an so on whe he was young.	I_S0
This is because he didn't have wonderful life expereince.	E_S0
Furthermore, young people are usually more likely to imitate some celebrities.	S_M1
Generally, teenagers have this instinctive behavior to imitate some elder who they like.	B_S0
For instance, when I study in my junior high school, my many classmates started to want to be a singer because they have a singer idol.	I_S0
They want to become a person who like their idol, such as can sing songs.	I_S0
And also my other classmates want to be a actor because a actor celebrity they like.	E_S0
It is apparently, teenagers have a imitation desire from they born, so they will think that these celebrities is most importa	O
 
Recently, the question regarding people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers has provoked attention from many people.	S_I0
As for me, I tend to help the struggling strangers rather than lazy friend.	S_T0
Firstly, a person who work hard could be respected easily.	S_M1
If a person spend his time at his own sweet will, predictablely, others will think he is  a depraved person and leave him far away.	B_S0
So it is undoubtedly that nobady would like to assist him and he will be defeated.	I_S0
For example, when the chairman of the famous company Huawei, Zheng fei Ren, established Huawei in 1987, he was 43 years old.	I_S0
Before he established Huawei, he had specialized in industry of information technology services over teo decades.	I_S0
It can be imagined that if he had no help to him he never succeed since power of a person is limited.	I_S0
Speaking of the reasons why others would like to assist him, I think the most important reason is his effots.	I_S0
He undergone unlimited failures but he did not forgive.	I_S0
Therefore his efforts add others' help to brought he success.	E_S0
Secondly, a struggling person has a wealth to get help from others.	S_M1
Because if a person do nothing to spend everyday and want not to improve his ability, others to help him he still be defeated.	B_S1
Since he has no ability that support he to seccedd.	E_S1
Taking into my account all the factors mentioned above, we may easily arrive on the conclusion that people are more willing to help	O
 
Issues related to the moral questions have been discussed in modern society.	S_I0
While people nowadays are regarded as becoming indifferent to help others, I still believe people today is able to care about others and it is more possible for them to offer help to others.	S_T0
The first reason is that people today are able to received more education of morality, which provides them with high sense of being accomdating.	S_M1
People today will get the education of the importance of helping others who are in troubles when they were young.	B_S0
Teachers in primary schools always tell stories and teach songs recording things about a person who likes helping others.	I_S0
For example, stories of LeiFeng are so familiar for Chinese that everyone are able to tell it.	E_S0
It should be admitted that there was the possibility that people in the past might be more likely to provide other people with the assitance they needed,since people were more innocent and the society are not as complex as today's during that time.	S_M1
Nowadays, it is not stranged to read a report that noboay is willing to give help to an old man who failed.	B_S0
However,in fact, it is just because a lot of examples of helping others are not be reported.	I_S0
The society are not so indifferent as we think, for more an more people who have high level of moral quality are entering the society and make the world to be better.	E_S0
In conclosion, although people in the past might be able to facilitate more frequently, people at prensent are more likely to help th1e struggling strangers for their education and moral quality.	S_C2
Therefore, people today is believed to be in support of others.	S_S2
 
Somebody says that young people doesn't need to have the ability to plan and organize.	B_T0
Hoever, my opinion is different.	I_T0
When it comes to the statement that it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize, I strongly agree.	E_T0
That is because their parents cannot always take care of them, and the ability to plan and organize can affect their acdemic success.	S_T1
Firstly, our parents will not allways be there when you need them.	S_M1
There will be some moments in your life when you encounters some diffculties and your parents cannot help you, and if you do not have the ability to plan and organize, you would be in a big trouble.	B_S0
For example, when I was in the USA, I did not have the ability to plan and organize, so when I was preparing for my classes for the new school, I did not really do any thing, and my parents did not helped me either.	I_S0
So when I appeared at school, I found out that I did not even have a pen!	I_S0
My first day at my new school were just horrible.	E_S0
Secondly, the ability to plan and organize can affect their acdemic success.	S_M1
I still remember that the year before last year I saw some news on the newspaper about a student who got an A plus in every subject dropped out from Qinghua University just because he did not have the ability to plan and organize!	B_S1
What a shame!	E_S1
To sum up, their parents cannot always take care of them, and this ability can affect your acdemic success.	B_C0
As a result, it is extremely important for young people to have the ability to plan and organize.	I_C0
I hope all the parents knows this and will teach ther children this ability, this will be good for them in the future.	E_C0
 
Parents nowadays have plenty of approaches to offer their money to their kids, one of which is that children in school age are awarded money closely related to the grades they get, which I think is an effective and encouraging techniques.	S_I0
To begin with, it is the lesson parents teached to their kids.	S_M0
The rule of adult world is imposing on you to be a competitive person, and the competition already begins at the early stage.	B_S0
The higher   grades they get, the more pocket cash they received, and the stronger purchase power they have.	I_S0
Similar to the basis that the better performance you accomplished, the higher bonus you get, children learn the simple theory through this vividly adapted approach.	E_S0
Also, it encourages children to improve their study method.	S_M0
For instance, if Sam did bad in the last exam and wanted to change the situation in the forecoming test, what he had to do was to reflect on what he did.	B_S0
Was it something wrong?	I_S0
How should I do to make things little better?	I_S0
Did I neglect or overstress the certain steps?	I_S0
Or were these lead to the inefficiency or depression that prevent me to do better?	I_S0
With all these thoughts and  assumed solutions he began the newly attempt to improve himself, which is definitely the excellent circulation to refresh oneself.	E_S0
Moreover, the experience children learned from this system of learning and rewarding and reflecting will contribute to the later working career.	S_M0
Some may argue that study isn't the whole thing of children and what they should to is to broaden their horizon and develop comprenhensively.	B_S0
However, the ways children adopted in study also function in many other walks of life.	I_S0
He or she may know the effective way of time management and self control.	I_S0
Or he may be familar to the ways to ask for their peers and teachers.	I_S0
Even he get used to the easy way to quickly learn the new concepts which may well-fit nowadays keep-updating enviorment.	I_S0
All these will make them a valued person with basic competitive skills.	E_S0
Money given to children shall link to the real world and teach them a lesson,which is exactly his way.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, with the growth of the population, more and more young people are living in the modern city.	S_I0
As people know , modern life is too complex for young people, it is possible for them to loss the ability to plan and organize.	S_T0
However, I still have opposite idea.	S_T1
It must be admitted that the modern city have too many influevce factors, some of them are not good for young people's physical and psychological health, but those are much more attractive for young people, once they get in touch with those kind of thing, they might be decadent, like some people around me, they are addicted to computer game, they might play games when they should be in class.	S_M1
Because of that, young people may not going to have a plan and organize their own life.	B_S1
Although there are too many influevce factors, I think young people will have the ability to plan and organize.	E_S1
Firstly, young people will get many protect in modern city.	S_M1
There are more and more education of things might be addicted for young people, they will know what is dangerous for them since they are a little children, also most of family only have one child, so parents will pay more attention to their child for get away from things might harm them.	S_S2
Also, young people with modern life will have better quality of education.	B_C1
In modern city, the school will have better teacher and better enviroment to study, so young people with modern life will be more clever, in other word, they can be better to plan and organize.	E_C1
 
Nowadays, giving children money when they get in school is popular in parents,espeically the people who are very young.	S_T1
In my opinion, that is not suitable for them to take too much money to school.	S_T0
On the one hand, the parents don't how their children use these money excatly.	S_M1
As a young school student, they are easily to influnenced by the wonderful world, so they can't contrl themselves as same as adults.	B_S0
If parents give them too much money they may use to do the things such as buying computer games using and so on.	I_S0
As a result, they may ignore their study and bocome a bad boy.	I_S0
On the other hand, giving too much money is not a good way to their's development.	I_S0
They may don't konw the hard to earn money because they think that parents wii give them moeny and they needn't to make living in themselves.	E_S0
Some parents may argue that when their children meet some sudden things, the money can help them.	S_M1
There is no doubt that people can't living without money.	B_S0
But if the children study in school safety, how they will meet the moment to use the money?	I_S0
They wiil get the help from the teacher if they meet the difficulties trutly.	E_S0
So the parents could only give them a little money in order to ensure they can buy snacks when they after school.	B_C0
Otherwies, they may grow to somebody parents don't want.	I_C0
Afterall, nobody could ignore the influence about the money.	E_C0
 
Recently, an interesting topic has aroused a heated debate: which ability is more important: ability of making new friends or the one of maintainning friends.	S_T1
The answer varies from person to person.	B_T0
From my perspective, I believe that the ability of maintaining friendship is more important and people can become more happy.	E_T0
To  begin with, ability of maintaining friendship is conducive to learning other's advantage and friends tend to be closer.	S_M1
As we know, maintianing relationship always take a long time to kown each othe better.	B_S0
As the deeper we know, every member in a small group are more likely to emerge their own upside and downside.	I_S0
For the upside of the friends, we can absord it, while for the downside of them, it does not hurt to remind them to correct, which is also consolidate our friendship.	I_S0
For example, I met a group of friends in a basketball team by playing together and later we exchanged our telephone number.	I_S0
As we chated in a group everyday, we found each person is attractive and they all had some advantages.	I_S0
I learned the sense of humor from one person and I was correct a mistake of careless by others.	I_S0
Eventually, we become best friends and always travel together in a holidy.	E_S0
Furthermore, maintaining friendship is helpful to save a lot of time on making new friends.	S_M1
This is because facing some people everyday we know other's quality and charateristic so we will avoid the topic of chatting, such as favorite food, favorite film, which allow us to try some new topics.	B_S0
On  the contrary, each time we make friends we always start to talk basic topics to know them superficially.	I_S0
If we save these time of talking boring things, we spend more time on dealing with something together with friends, which would be the precious memory for the friendship.	I_S0
To illustrate, when I chat with my friends I will continue our topic that ended last time.	I_S0
So our relationship is moving on all the time.	I_S0
Last week we decided to travel to Beijing next holiday and I am looking forward to this trip.	E_S0
To sum up, It is advisable that the ability of maintainning friendship is more important than ability of making new friends.	S_C2
 
Nowadys, more and more people feel sressuful in their job, all of them need a high efficiency to relax themselves.	S_I0
So there are two agurements in front of them.	S_T1
One of them choose relax by watching and read, and the other of them are willing to do physical exercise.	B_T0
I agree with the first point, because I think when you have been stressful and tired,you need to relax your body ,I think it is the most aviliable way to relax.	E_T0
From my standpoint of view,relaxing by watching a movie and reading books is a mild way.	S_M0
As we know, when a people   feel back breaking, the most of them just want to go to the bed,and sleep for a long time.	B_S0
Why they want to do that?	I_S0
Because their bodies feel too tired, so the capacity in their bodies can't support their work.	I_S0
You can imagine that if you have been tired but you chosed to relax by doing physical, you must feel more back breaking.	I_S0
So I think the first point is better.	E_S0
Furthermore,I think watching a movie or reading a book is relax your brian.	S_M0
For example, many times, the fatigue is not come from your body, they might come from your brain ,is is a mentally tired,  so at this time, you relax by doing physical exercise is a low level efficiency.	B_S0
Adversly, you need to watchi a movie and read a book,they can decrease the stress faster than doing physical.	I_S0
That's why I support the first point.	E_S0
Finally, when you reading a book or watching a movie, they can attract your atterntion, when you pay attention on other things, you might not take care of your fatigue.	S_M0
For example, when you are tired, you will drink a coffee and do something else,that a typical example of the point, because the work attract your attention so that you won't be much tired.	S_S2
To sum up, the first way is a way which is higher level efficiency and all-sided, because it could help you to relax from many aspects,your mentally tired and it can attract your attention.	B_C1
So,from the all responds above, I agree with the first point.	E_C1
 
In our daily lives, mistakes seem to be unavoid while working or study which may be result from the exhausted power or losing concentration.	B_T1
However, making mistakes and learning from them for children should be allowed by parents have bben debated.	I_T1
As far as I am concerned, parents should allow their kids to do this.	E_T1
To begin with, making mistakes and learning from it is an effective way to progress.	S_M0
Since after you making mistakes, you may be punished or pay the price for their actions.	B_S0
It will leave a deep impression in their mind and thy will not do this next time.	I_S0
Take my experience for example, in my final examination, I forgot an important equation and performed bad in the math examination.	I_S0
Therefore, I was not able to get the prize from the teacher.	I_S0
After that, I never forgot this equation.	E_S0
Second, it is helpful to to the children's development of the personality.	S_M0
Because if the parents do not allow their kids to make any mistakes and learn from it or even punish thei kids.	B_S0
The kids may be afraid of making mistakes and even try their best to conceal their mistakes in order to avoid punishment.	I_S0
If things continue like this way, they will be unwilling to communicate with the parents due to the threaten from the parents.	I_S0
It may cause the mental problem that will even influence their relationship with other people.	I_S0
In order to let the kids grow healthily, parents should let their kid make mistakes.	E_S0
If the parents do not allow their kid to make mistakes, it really can make the kids to be careful.	S_M0
My math teacher said that he always asked his kid to be careful while doing math questions and after longtime, his kid really always get full marks in the examination because of  his cautious that developed in his daily life.	B_S1
However, it is good for developing a good habit, it still have harm to the kids to grow up.	E_S1
To sum up, I strongly agree parents to allow their kid make and learn from mistakes.	S_C2
 
Nowadays,a contriversia title become more and more popular in people's conversation such as people prefer to help struggling stranger now.	S_I0
Some people support it because people are.	S_T0
The other people are against since people arless kind.	S_S0
In my view of point.	S_T1
I totally disagree it.	B_S0
Here are some reasons in the following words.	E_S0
To start with,people are stressful so that they are not focusing on the social communication,thus prefering going away rather than giving a hand.	S_M1
Comparing now and the past 100 years,it is obvious that people have more things to do now.	B_S0
So if there is a struggling stranger who need help,I deem that most individuals will omit it.	I_S0
I have the similar experiement,When I did riding with my uncle,I lost myself for my slow speed.	I_S0
I was a child,so crying aloud.	I_S0
However,nobody offered a help,instead they suddenly went back.	I_S0
Somebody who wear a suit went to a company for their work,somebody who its a bus diver continue their work.	I_S0
Every body are too busy to care for a child.	I_S0
That's why I said this.	E_S0
In addition,people who live in the past have undoed the difficulty and don't want others undo it again.100 years before,many people are straved.	S_M1
It means that they know the difficulty of life.	B_S0
So if there a people who is very hungry,most people will offered a big meal for the person because they used to get the help form others.	I_S0
My grandfather once toldme that when he is young,they are very poor and always maintain living by begging.	I_S0
So when they see a people a person who  in finecial need,they will offer a help.	I_S0
At least for now,most people didn't undo these kinds of difficulty so they don't think it is a big deal for a person who can't get help.	E_S0
.	S_S2
 
Perhaps nothing has been able to exert a greater impact on our daily lives than Internet.	S_I0
By using computers,fax machines, telephone and Internet can handle different matters at home ，the overall effect of this change is positive effect ,although some information in Internet will bring some problem.	S_T1
First of all, the widespread application of there technologies can improve effiency, allowing people to exchange information and documents regardless of time and geograpgical limitatiom, many woring people benifit from this technological innovation, because household office has replaced commutes	B_M0
The internet promotes freedom of information and speech.	E_M0
With innumerable news sources at their disposal ,citizens have the oppotunities to stuy at home through long distance education, and this knoeledge will allow them to cintribute to society.	B_S1
Oh the other hand , Internet will connect people of the same interests, encourage  themwork together and they will become active participants of society rather than passive subjuects.	E_S1
Another criticism of Internet information is that  most of the information in Internet is unedited,contain unwanted content,like pornographic website and computer games.	S_M0
It is possible that those children who are exposed to those infomation might experience aggresive fantasies.	S_S2
there are ways that one can navigate the information of Internet ,	O
 
In my opinion, it is right to learn from their own mistakes, but I do not think allow children make mistakes is correct.	S_T0
Children are at the age of learning things, so the huge amount of mistakes they make is really a great opportunity for them to learn.	B_T1
And the problem is how, how we can let them learn from mistakes?	I_T1
Forgiveness does do, but in this case children will not remenber it clearly or just forget it rapidly.	E_T1
And I think punishment is the best tutor to teach them lessons.	S_S2
Children are young, so it is commen for them to making mistakes.	S_M2
But when they ever make mistakes, as a parent, you should critisize them immediately.	B_S0
Or they will consider your forgiveness as a permition.	I_S0
That means although I make mistake, no matter how serious they are, my parents would not punish me.	I_S0
As the result, your children will not follow your rules ever again.	I_S0
But how about critisize and punishment?	I_S0
The hurting result might warn them for the rest of their life.	I_S0
I don't ask you to beat your child but to punish by a kind of soft way, like no TV for a week, cannot eat candy for two days or write an article to outline thier fault.	I_S0
These way will let them not to make the same mistakes again.	I_S0
And this is the real rilable and remarkable way to let children learn lessons from their fault.	E_S0
In conlusion, my perspective is that forgiveness all the time is not the best way to teach children how to be a better person, punishment do.	B_C1
That's why I am standing against the statement .	E_C1
 
Parents approches to educate their chidren are  essential, nowadays there consists of an conflicts in parents.	S_I0
Some monitors hold the view that chidren should't make mistakes but others think make mistakes is irreversible and they need let their child learn from mistakes.	B_T1
As far as I'm concrened, making mistakes is frequnt in yonger generations, parents who educate their child in their errors and let them learn from it seem have great inflence in children life.	E_T1
Firstly, teenagers have their own perspctive in some thing,though sometimes their thougts are conflict to the truth.	S_M1
But as a parent,educating their child is not to change their child's approch toward the erros.	B_S0
On the controy, younger students go through their mistakes they would have though about what they made was wrong.	I_S0
In this time, parents lead their child to learn from their own mistakes have great impacts in their child.	E_S0
Add to these, teenagers have nagtive mentality in everything parents talk about.	S_M1
Actually ,parents can't aviod their child misatkes.	B_S0
It seems that education is the only way to make students succed.	I_S0
Parents need is to make their child didn't make the same mistakes in the second time.	I_S0
For example, I once learn ride biycicle,but I could't make balence.	I_S0
I was frustred about it and wanted to asked for some help from my parents.	I_S0
But my parents didn't say any word, they thought ride bike need my own relized the erroes approches.	I_S0
Afer my practised over and over, I gradully learn the appropiate way to do.	E_S0
In another word, I learn this skills by learn from my own mistakes,and my parents also eduacted me  learn someting by mysle	O
 
Nowadays, there is an interesting topic around us, should government improve the safety by hiring more police or improve the old buildings and streets to attract more tourists?	B_I0
It is true that different people have various opinions towards the same thing.	E_I0
Actually, as far as I am concerned, I agree with this idea and my point of view is supported by the following reasons.	S_T0
First of all, safety is always the first place to be taken into consideration when people decide to go to another places during the period of their vacation.	S_M1
Tourists will be worried about the safety money and ourselves when go to an unsafe place, thus would be likely to have no good mood to appreciate the fantastic secens or local traditional culture.	B_S0
However, thing is different when safety is guaranteed such as hiring more police, it will give tourists a pyscological suggestion and they are going to enjoy their vacation with their families or friends without any worries.	I_S0
Take my example for an example, last summer vacation I went to Brusty with my parents, there were not enough police and local people, although the natural scenery was beautiful, such as the colorful flowers and green trees, however, we had no mood to appreciate them because we felt horrible from the bottom of our heart as there were no people around as.	E_S0
Besides, improving the appearance by improving the old buildings and streets can boost the local economy to some degree because more and more people would choose there for vacation.	S_M1
Imaging that there are some old buildings in a traditional Chinese style alongside the street, the houses are made of white and black materials, there are few people walking along the street, people will feel a kind of tranquil beauty.	B_S0
It is also easier for them to get release of daily pressure and relax themselves from this special experience when walking on the old streets.	I_S0
Actually,  more and more people will come here and thus increasing more job opportunities for the local people.	I_S0
In other words, the government can make profit from this process and the local economy will be improved to some degree.	E_S0
To sum up, I hold the belief that it is important for the government to improve safety and the appearance in order to attract more tourists.	S_C2
 
Running, playing the basketball and playing the soccor, all of those are hight common physical exercise in our life.	B_I0
These exercise not only never fail up to help us release the pressure in our dailylife, but also help us know more new friends who have the common interests.	E_I0
In my opinion, I oppose the point that the physical exercises are important for the old than for the young.	S_T0
In the first place, it is a common phenomenon that young people have more pressur than the old; therefore, they are the people who are more supposed to do physical exercises.	S_M0
Having a glimpsing into the society, young people in the university ought to face the massive paper and perplex coarse; young people who lately graduate from the university are struggled to find a appreciate job and even do not have enough money to live in a confortable appartment.	B_S0
On the contrast, old in the society mostly have the high salary job and they even need not to cencern about the money since they have chilfren to take care of them.	I_S0
Therefore, the living stress are bigger than the young.	I_S0
Owing to the fact that I can shift my concentration from the work and just relax myself when I play basketball, the young are supposed to do more physical exercise than old.	I_S0
This way, young can escap from the daily grind of live.	E_S0
In the second place, doing physical exercise can help young who recently enter the university and have not friend to make new friends.	S_M0
My own experience can successifully illustrate this oppinoin.	B_S0
When I entered the university, nobody want to make friends with me, a shy boy with a meanger body.	I_S0
After that, I played basketball everyday, which make me was equipped with a good basketball skill and a strounger body.	I_S0
Then I always could make new friends in the games and friends in the unversity basketball team owing to the fact that I can use my excellent skill to cooperate with my mates to win the games.	I_S0
Compared with the old who have lots of friends in their long life, the young people are the grounp who really need to   do the physical exercise.	E_S0
Some people assert that old people are supposed to do more physical exercise as their body are not wealthey as the young.	S_M0
Nevertheless, this is unreasonnal.	B_S0
We can not obtain a shot perspective.	I_S0
Like it or not, the bad heathey condition are caused by the absence of physical exercise in the young age.	I_S0
This kind of bad happit accumulate for a long time such as decades of years, which will cause lots of illiness including the back illiness.	I_S0
Therefore, young people should to set up a good habit to do more physical exercises to avoid illiness in the old age.	E_S0
To sum up, physical exercises are important for young as li	S_C2
 
People nawdays would surely take the job which placed befor the, instead of wating for another one.	S_T1
We can see what a hard life a person who is out of job is suffering.	B_T0
So the sooner they get a job, the better.	E_T0
And I believe that the people also tend to take risk of their carrer becasue if they failed, they will face the terrible implications.	S_T1
First, if one person lives in the society, he or she need to spend money on somthing, so that's why we need a job to support ourselves.	S_M0
Take Steve Jobs for an instance, when he was a young man, he needed to feed himself, so he chose to take the job offered to him without thinking, but then a better opprtunity was shown before him, when he was asked about this experience, he said that he did't regret for this because the excatly knew that the most important thing at that stage of his life was to feed himself so that he could have the opportunity to make his dreams come true, he couldn't live without money at that time.	B_S1
So it's obvious that people won't wait for another job coming becasue they cannot make life run normally without money.	E_S1
Second, people tend to take no risk when they are choosing a job because this is an important thing so that they won't bet on it.	S_M0
For example, when I was graduating from my college, I appied for a job immediately whcih was not so good, but the condition didn't allowed me to wait, because this was one of the most important thing in my life, I couldn't take risky.	B_S1
If I gave the job, someone else would replace me, and the competitors were so many that you had to make a choice befor you have thought it over, so most of us would take a job if there was any of them was availiable.	E_S1
Last, some people may argue that during the wating peroid, people could gain enough experience so that they would be more competitive in their other interview or apply for another job.	S_M0
But the fact was that in a job, you can get most experience, because during a job, you were practicing no matter how much the salary was.	B_S1
When I talked to my cousin, he always regreted that he didn't get the job shown before him and one of his classmates took it and then when he was applying for another job angin with his classmates, he didn't succeed but his classmate did sicne he have enough experience which was asked by the company.	E_S1
 
The education of our next generation is a hot debated field.	B_I0
Peers and teachers play a indispensable role in our school life.	I_I0
Some people believe that students are more influenced by their teachers than by their friends.	E_I0
However, as for me, I think the peers of me will contribute more impact to shape my personality than teachers do.	S_T0
Not only because we live together so we have more attachment, but also it will be easier for us to learn something form the opponents.	S_T1
First of all, compared to the teachers, we have more interaction with our peers, by which we can observe and learn from  them from lots of different perspects.	S_M2
Everybody will have this kinds of experence, you spend 10 hours in school, and there are only 1 or 2 hours for you to working with your teacher, while maybe you spend all these hours on working with your classmates.	B_S0
So, absolutely we can learn and observe them from all the aspect like playing together, stadying togerther or even falling in lovewith each other.	I_S0
For exmple, my high school roommate falling love with one of our classmate.	I_S0
Initially, they have different characteristics, like my roommate alway play games while his girl friend prefer reading.	I_S0
Then they reading together, eating together, and taking some trips together.	I_S0
He always talking about his girl friend when we chat with him.	I_S0
And after a year,we find my roommate not only like to eat same things like his GF, but he never play computer games in our dorm anymore, instead of reading!	I_S0
His girl friend solve one big problem which his teacher and parents can't takle!	I_S0
So, I believe the influence form peers can be in anywhere and strongly.	E_S0
Then, when we are competing with others, we will try our best to observe them to find a way to win the battle, it obviously give us a great chance to learn from them.	B_C0
In my high school, teachers would rank our grades and publish the list about the ranking.	I_C0
In that time I will always oberseving the guys who have higher grades.	E_C0
And Iearn their good habits in study.	S_S2
I try to cultivate myself to gain these hobits	O
 
Many people would say that parents can offer their children money for their academic program because children will have faith this material reward.	B_T0
I agree that children should bepaid of if their reach higher level in school.	E_T0
After all when I was young, my parents awarded me 100RMB for my excellent exam results, However, in my opinion, parents cannot pay their children just for letting children focus on study.	S_T1
Firstly, as we all know, children are lack of self-control, and there are too many temptations in this world like pretty dresses, computer games and toys which are usually banned by their parents.	S_M1
But if young children acquire money from their parents, they can get closer to even seduced by these temptations, ignoring their academic study.	B_S0
Bob, my classmate during primary school, would be perpect one intending to support this idea.	I_S0
As the best student in class, he was given money by his parents for maintaininf his top grade, however Bob start to enter the internet cafe and buy expensive item of games, leading to decline of his test result.	I_S0
Obviously it is the material world and insuffiebt self control corrupted Bob.	E_S0
Scondly, children may lose their pursuit and become snobbish during the fiancial incentive besause childhood is an important period for people to develop their values.	S_M1
Having realized the fact that money can be  acquied by higher grade, childreb take serious attention to money instead of other pursuits.	B_S1
Many student have encourges by the money from their parents, but at least Bikita, my mother'S childhood friend, is not the case.	E_S1
She used to dream of brcoming an artist	O
 
Celebrities like fomous people or well-known athletes tend to have a great influence on people nowadays.	B_I0
Some people think that the influence those people have on younger people is much greater than it on older people.	E_I0
I personally agree with this statement for the reason that the old people tend to be less-cared about celebrities and also they would learn from those people who made great contribution to our society like outstanding presidents or great scientists.	S_T0
On one hand,unlike young people who are crazy about famous people's affairs and they will know everything about people they found of,old people usually have a deaf ears to those famous people's news.	S_M0
If you asked your grandparents who the Jay zhou is?	B_S0
they would answer i do not know that person I just know president Mao.	I_S0
Morever old people tend yo focus on other things like exerciseing their body and taking care of their pets and grand children.	E_S0
On the other hand,old people are likely to learn from those people who had made greart contribution to our society like outstanding presidents or scientisits.	S_M0
You will alway hear about old people talking about history and it is obviously they admire those people .	B_S1
They can tell young people a series of events about historial person .	E_S1
Last but not least,young people are now exposed to media.	S_M0
They can get in touch with new things quickly .	B_S0
They are easily to be touched by things those famous people do.	I_S0
Like if one celebrity does somthing good or bad ,they will know at once and they will show their attitudes to that famous people.	I_S0
Morever young people are fond of athletes very much and they are usually touched by those behaviours.	I_S0
For example Mike Jordan's famous story can be told by almost every teenager and his sacrifice to  his carrer and fiting experience inspire a lot young people.	E_S0
In conclusion.	B_C0
old people tend to care less about well known person,so that they are less influenced by those famous people.	I_C0
However young people are easily to be affected in both mental and physical.	E_C0
 
All the parents wants their children do well on the all exam, so some of parents will offer children some money when the kids get a high grade, i think this is a good way to encourage their children.	S_T1
One of my classmate he always didbad on the exam.	S_M1
He liked play games and he wanted to pay money to have good item in the games,but his mom hoped that his son could do well on the exam, so she told him if he can have a high grade on next exam then she will offer him some money for the games.	B_S0
He started to study after his mom told him this decision.	I_S0
He stoped fooling around in the class and focused in the class,even he went to extra help after class.	I_S0
Althought it was hard in the begining but he did not give up, he finally got a good grade in the next exam and he got the money for his games!	I_S0
it was very helpful for him and it changed him, he found the interest in study.	E_S0
I used did well on the exam but i gave up, i started to play games with my friends.	S_M1
My mom was mad after she found out that i always play games with my friends, she told me that if i can do well in the furture she will offer me money.	B_S0
so i decided to study after she told me.	I_S0
I studied pretty hard  tried to do well on the exam and i did.	I_S0
It helped me with my grade and it was a good experience.	E_S0
All in all, i think offer money to children it is a good idea to increase the grade, it can encourage the children and make them like to study.	S_C2
 
When peaple see someone strughling in studying or working,they can usually get a feeling of positivation.	S_T1
As a result of this state,they can become interested in the person who always make an effort to try their best to achieve something wheather they know him before or not.	B_T0
I support the statement that peaple today are willing to help the struggling strangers.	E_T0
On the one hand,it is eventually an action which is the symbol of helping others.	S_M2
It shows and sprites the love between each other in the sociate.	B_S0
there is no need to do much things but a little thing such as give a piece of bread to someone has been hungry for a few days can make a great diffrences.	I_S0
On the other hand, as the proccess when we help others,we can also find ourselves and improve ourselves.	I_S0
It is meaningful to do things are not only good to oneself but also to a large world.	E_S0
In the former time, peaple were more indeedly willing to help the peaple who is their friends or relative inside of giving a hand to someone that they had never met before.	S_C2
Hovever,at the present time,peaple also become glad to help a strange man because they discover the spirit of struglling on them.	B_S1
It is obviously a symbol of peace and love.	E_S1
We can find the world more open inside this statement	O
 
Have you ever seen people who have a lot of friends but don't have any working skills in the society?	S_I0
Although some people in the society think that the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school, when it comes to the opinion that studying hard in school is more important than the ability to relate well to prople, I strongly agree.	B_T0
There are three reasons  to explain my opinion.	E_T0
First of all, I believe that when we were studing in school, we were not just study knowlegdes.	S_M1
The more important we should train is our study ability.	B_S0
In other word, wo should find out the most effective way for us to study.	I_S0
The reason of why the study skill is really important is that we should keep learning untill we close our eyes.	I_S0
For example, if we work for doctor, the knowlegdes that we learn in the university of course is not enough.	I_S0
We should learn from other books and from our patients.	I_S0
Then we can do the latter jobs more perfectly.	I_S0
Our fame will improve because of our skillful ability.	I_S0
If we don't keep learning, we will be more out of style undoutedly.	E_S0
Futhermore, I think that the knowledges you learned from school is more important to us to live in the society than the ability to relate will to people.	S_M1
For instance, if we just know how to get along well with people, of course many people will think that we are an interesting people.	B_S0
But if they realize that we just know how to attract people's attention and don't have any ability to bring some benifits to them.	I_S0
We are just their friends and they won't give any benifits to you.	I_S0
Therefore, you won't success undoutedly.	E_S0
Finally,	S_S2
 
Nowadays nearly every one have a mobile phone or a computer include children, we use them to play games, make friends in scoial networking Web site and read news.	B_I0
Do these make it harder to educate oour child?	E_I0
Although there many people don not think it is a problem, I think it does bring many problem in education.	S_T0
At first, children spend more time playing online game or using cell phone, the time they spend in studying will become less and less.	S_M0
We all konw that study is a thing need a huge amount of time , without a lots of time, a child can not do well in his school work.	B_S0
For example, my aunt's son was crazy about online game on mobile phone.	I_S0
He plays it every day before he go to bed .	I_S0
It took nearly a hour pre day, and during that time, most of his classmates are studying.	I_S0
It very clear he can not do better than the classmate who study for a longer hour.	E_S0
Then, children may learn something bad from Internet or game, such as dirty words and violence.	S_M0
On the Internet, there so many things should not be offered to child.	B_S0
But there only a few child know what they should learn and what they can not learn.	I_S0
For examlp , once I took the bus home.	I_S0
I heard a boy behind me who was only six years old or younger ask his friend what is the mean of a dirty word, he just read it in social networking Web site.	I_S0
After that, he repeated this dirty word again and again.	I_S0
Clearly, no praents want their child learn that.	E_S0
Although children can learn some knowledge in onine game and social networking Web site.	S_M0
Like the recording of lecture in Internet.	B_S0
But comparing with other interesting things, I do not think children will chose them instead of playing game.	I_S0
So it is a thing that have more drawback.	E_S0
I don not think the mobile phone, online game and social networking Web site will make our children better.	B_C0
May be there will be a new way of education by using them in the future.	I_C0
But it is more difficult to educate children beacuse of t	E_C0
 
The education serves as an important role in forming one's views of value, which is the reason why all parents pay a lot of attention to their children's education.	S_I0
Some contend that parents should not offer money for high grade thier children get, while I believe it is feasible for parents to do so because the bonus could help motivate the children and it can teach childredn to arrange their own economic plans.	S_T1
To begin with, the money offeed by parents for the high grade can be a very good incentive to motivate children.	S_M1
On most occasions, children study hard in order to obtain the recognition from their parents rather than for themselves.	B_S0
Hence the bonus can serve as a kind of compliment for children's work and motivate them to study even harder.	I_S0
Take myself as a example, when I was in 3rd grade in primary school, I did really poor in English.	I_S0
Before the final exam of that term, my mom promised that I would get a 100 yuan bonus if I could improve my English grade.	I_S0
So I studied hard because I wanted my mom to think that his son was a useless bad student.	I_S0
Then it turned out that Imade it and got my bonus, therefore I believe the bonus can be really effective motivation.	E_S0
Moreover, the bonus can also teach children how to deal with their owm money and make good economic plans.	S_M1
After a child get the money for a good grade, he has many alternatives, such as buying a new book or new a new bike, or just donate the money to those in need.	B_S0
No matter how he decided to spend the money, the process of making decision helps develop a good habit of planing and a sense of responsibility for one's own wealth.	I_S0
As a student majored in finance, I have once read a paper based on this topic and the thoery of behavioral finance.	I_S0
The conclusion of the paper is that people who had control of their own  money in thier childhood are more prone to make more money in the future.	I_S0
So the bonus for high grade is aslo helpful in teaching children to make plans of their own money.	E_S0
Some people may say that giving children too much money can cause thier abuse of money, while I think this problem is excatly how my second opinion could work to help solve.	S_C2
For thereaso	O
 
Recently, a topic that is closely related to dreams and reality has aroused a heated debate: should people always follow their dreams even if the dreams are ambitious, or focus on achieving their realistic goals?	S_I0
In my opinion, I definitely support that people should focus on their realistic aims.	S_T0
To begin with, achiving realistic goals can help people realize the sense of contentment.	S_M1
Everyone has their own goals, such as buying a big house, and marrying a good person.	B_S0
They will make great efforts to realize their goals, and then they will be able to live happy life.	I_S0
Just as the saying goes, "contentment is happiness", people will feel happy when their goals are achieved.	I_S0
For example, my uncle is working in Beijing, and all he wanted was buying a house in Beijing.	I_S0
He worked very hard for ten years, and he promoted very fast in his company.	I_S0
As a result, he earned enough money to buy a 150-square-meter house near the center of Beijing.	I_S0
Now, he is satisfied with his life and	E_S0
Moreover, achiving realistic goals can bring people sense of accomplishment.	S_M1
When people have remote dreams to reach, they will always work hard on them.	B_S0
They may face a lot of difficulties to approach their dreams, and they will experience failures many times, which may strike their confidence.	I_S0
However, realistic goals is relatively easy to achieve compared with ambitious dreams.	I_S0
When the realistic aims are reached, people will get sense of accoplishment which will motivate them to do more things and set a further goal.	I_S0
For instance, I usually set a goal for myself, such as getting a good score on my exam, or reading a good book in two days.	I_S0
When I reach my goal, I will get a sense of success because I have learned a lot from it.	E_S0
From what has been mentioned above, we can draw a conclution that	O
 
Nowedays, advertisement bacome an behavior that companys use it to introduce their objects, but this behavior cause some problems, one of it is that some real objects are difference with advertisement .	S_I0
So I agree with the statement.	S_T0
For example, in the past I ordered an cake on Internet for my best friends birthday party.	S_M1
Before I order it,  I scan many pictures on onlion and choose an cake that I think it looks beautiful.	B_S0
When my friends birthday coming,   I reseive this cake.	I_S0
When I bring it to the party and open it, I found this cake is so ugly and almost every details is different with the picture that I saw.	I_S0
The color is so odd and the decoration of it is so mess, even I can organize the shape, of course , the taste is not good.	I_S0
So because this cake, the atmosphere become embarrassing, and everyone cannot enjor themselves.	E_S0
Another story, In a period, my friends like shopping onlion, so she order many clothes on Internet.	S_M1
She see these clothes on modle are beautiful, so she think the real appearance of these clothes must be that.	B_S0
Some days later, she take the clothes and found the materials of these are bad, and some clothes even are another appearance compared with the picture.	I_S0
So she spend much money on that, but the result of that is terrible.	E_S0
Finally, when I was child, I watched the televison with my mother, and I saw a advertisement about a clock, and this clock had beautiful sound and the shape of it is so cute, and I ask my mom to buy it, but my mother told me the most advertisement is unconving and it just in order to make more benefits for commercial company, but I cannot belive it, so my mother buy it finally.	B_C1
But after several weeks, I found the color of it is fade, and the sound did not listen as good as the advertisement play it.	E_C1
 
As the education problems become more and more commenly, parents focus on their chidren grade frenquently than before.	B_S0
now the phenomon around the world is that some parents offer thrie school-age children money for their good job, and the children accept it proundly.	I_S0
Is this s good idea for childrens' growth?	I_S0
In my views, it is a good way to encourage the child to achieve their goals and also can educate the child how to manerge their money.	E_S0
firstly, if the children aware to the money can help them to buy some toys, books, modles, and eles they really want.	S_M2
they will willing to offer their efforts to get the high mark.	B_S0
take my sister for example, she is a book-worm, and spemd almost money for her books, even if, there are still not enough for her.	I_S0
So our parents told her that if she could get A for all the class, they should offer the money that she can use it to buy a E-books.	I_S0
she was inspired for our parents and work very eearnestly, everyday I waek up, she is doing some previews, and when I go to bed, she is	E_S0
 
In my opinion, telling the truth is not alway the most important consideration in any relation ship between people.	S_T0
Some time the lies can encourage people, then improve the relationship and truth will broke the relationship and cause some predictable conflict.	B_T1
Sometime telling the truth is nessesary, telling the shortage and disadvantage about each other can be mutual benefit.	E_T1
Firstly, sometime the lies is nessesary in a relationship.	S_M0
The kind lies can encourage people and improve the relationship.	B_S0
This kind of lies can make your friend more confidence and feel better, when he realize this is not true but he can understand you.	I_S0
For example, someone is having  cancer and  going to die.	I_S0
In this situation, his friend tell him the cancer can be heal by eating apple.	I_S0
We know that is not true, but that will give a hint to the patient, he has opportunity to live, so he will not give up.	I_S0
This lie give the patient confidence and encourage him to live.	E_S0
Secondly , sometime the truth will broke the relationship and cause some conflicts.	S_M0
The truth is not always good, some time people prefer listening the lies rather than truth.	B_S0
For example, in a birthday party, your friend give a gift to you.	I_S0
Maybe the gift is not your dishes, but if you tell him the gift is bad, your friends think that is offend, then  relationship will be damaged, and will cause the argue between you and your friend.	I_S0
This problem is not about principle, use kind lie will not damage the relationship	E_S0
Beside that, sometime the truth is important in a relationship.	S_M0
Telling the shortage an disadvantage about each other can be multibenefit.	B_S0
For example, the father find his son steal the needdles form other family.	I_S0
If he did not tell his son the truth, stealing is a illegle thing, his son will think the stealing is not a big deal then continue to steal.	I_S0
In this situation , truth can be benifit to other.	E_S0
In concusion,sometime we need to tell the truth, some time we need to lie, it dependent on the situation.	B_C1
Therefore telling the truth is not fit all situation in any relationship	E_C1
 
Nowadays, globalization is the common trend for world development.	B_I0
There are millions of events happen every minute and people are able to read stories and events happened all over the world through the internet.	I_I0
A large number of things are closly related to us; some of them are unrelated to our life.	E_I0
In my opinion, I believe it is important for us to know events happening in different countries; it is not neccessary to know all of them, but the more we know, the better for ourselves.	S_T0
First of all, Reading international newspaper is a good method to know all the important events that just happened around the world.	S_M1
International newspaper contains not only domestic news, but also foreign news.	B_S0
I usually read the newspaper every morning when I am eating my breakfast.	I_S0
I think a breif understading of those events will give me more topics while I am communicate with others.	I_S0
Current events are always good topics among relatives, friends and collegues.	I_S0
People like to discuss news, especially international news during the coversation.	I_S0
They think international news are interesting and giving them more imagination space because this is something that far away from them.	I_S0
Knowing international news will help me to join the conversation more easily and is a good method to find topics to communicate with people.	E_S0
Secondly, I think knowing international events can broder my thoughts.	S_M1
people usually can learn something from an event and accumulated them for later use.	B_S0
In China, the hiring managers are prefer to test the candidates' knowledge about different field.	I_S0
They want someone who knows all different things around world instead of somebody who only know about study.	I_S0
For example, the hiring manager had asked me about the economic influence that the Trump's new rules brought to China.	I_S0
At first, I have to know who Trump is and what new rules he has establised, then I can answer the question about economic influence.	I_S0
I will not able to answer it if I do not know this event relate to America, so it is essential to know those events.	E_S0
Overall, globalization has forced people to know more about the whole world.	B_C0
We need to open the eyes to see the world instead to limite ourselves in our small area.	I_C0
There is no harm to know events happened all over the world.	I_C0
We can learn the good things they did and avoid to repeat the bad things.	I_C0
The best  improve our countries is by learning form other.	E_C0
 
To ecourage children on study, many parents constantly invent different ways.	S_I0
Some parents offer their children money for each high grade they get in school because they think it's useful to improve children's score.	S_T1
However, I don't think it's a good idea regarding of its negative impacts on children.	S_T0
Firstly, this idea totally concentrates on score but overlook the importance of knowledge out of the range of exams.	S_M1
As we known, grade can not accurately show how much knowledge do the students really have.	B_S0
Some people can get a high mark in exams but they know less about what happened out of textbooks and lack in common sense.	I_S0
Offering school-age children money for each high score would make the children feel that only their grades are important, which is harmful for them to gain a large horizen and a great range of knowledge.	E_S0
Besides, this idea is too utilitarian for children, which is bad for establish a habit of long-term study.	S_M1
If parents give their children money once they get a high score, the children would like to pay their attention most on money but not study itself.	B_S1
When they become adults, no one will immediately give them money for their studying of new skills and knowledge and then they have less motivation to	E_S1
 
I disagree the statement that relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercises The reasongs are as follows:	S_S2
Firstly,as the proverb says:the body is the foundation of the revolution.	S_I0
Without a strong body,we could not accomplish any task.	B_T1
Obviously,some physical exercise can strenthed our body.	E_T1
Nowadays,more and more people have a sick body which is the main factor that prevent them doing better work or having a better scores.	S_S0
If they could do some exercise rather than sit on the seat too long time,they will have a stronger body than they own now.	S_T1
Besides,physically exercise could also relax both our brains and body,which is much better than sitting in the seat to reading books or watching movies.	B_S0
As for me,study maths too long time could make me feel tired,in this time some appropriate exercise make my brains relaxed.	I_S0
It is supposed to give me enough energy to continue my work.	I_S0
What's more,reading a book or watching a movie will waste too much time.	I_S0
An usual movie is always more than 2 hours,it is too long in doing works.	I_S0
But 20 minutes exercise will make us more relaxed and save a lot of time to complete our tasks.	I_S0
And then,our main work is to study,reading boos the whole day will make our brains more and more tired,it is not a good method to relax.	E_S0
As metioned above,doing exercise is quite a brilliant way to have a relax rather than reading books or watching movies.	B_S1

Although knowing what is happening around the world seems unrelated to our daily life, it is actually an invisible driving force behind our life and influence us to a great extent, which both expands our horizons and manipulating our own country's polices.	S_I0
First, knowing the global affairs can expand our outlook.	S_M1
Outlook plays a crucial role in individual development and it is not what we experience but how we think about an issue that matters.	B_S0
We form our own thoughts through a wide range of information and knowledge.	I_S0
If we watch global news, we will know different cultures, religions and ways of living, and these kinds of information all provide a chance for ourselves to reflect on ourselves.	I_S0
For example, if we know that Japanise people can evacuate safely in an earthquake because they obey to those who organise the evacuation, we can learn from them when we face any similar crisis.	I_S0
This information does raise our own awareness of being organised and following instructions.	E_S0
Second, knowing current affairs all over the world can help us know the policy that still influences our daily life.	S_M1
What is happening around the world will influence the status and policies of our own country.	S_C1
For example, China is now having a trade war against America.	B_S0
In this case, the imported goods from America may be restricted.	E_S0
For those businessmen who run companies selling products to America or importing goods from America will be heavily influenced.	S_C1
Therefore, they have to follow the newest policies according to the latest current affairs.	B_S0
Therefore,	E_S0
 
Nowadays, as the step of society goes faster, there is a hot debate whether cooking and preparing foods costs less time in twenty years than it does today.	S_I0
After all, the technoloy is very advanced today, and it will be more advanced in twenty years.	B_T0
When you make an order on Internet, you can get what you want to eat in three minutes in China.	I_T0
However, in my opinion, people in twenty years are willing to take time to cook and prepare foods for these reasons.	E_T0
Firsty, the awareness of healthy life will be improved in twenty years.	S_M1
This is because nowadays the young who are about twenty have begun to study healthy manus to stay wholesome, while our grandparents just considered how to survive in their young age.	B_S0
Many young people began to pay attention to high quality of life and they have grown up in well-off family.	I_S0
In this case, they don't worry about how to fill with their stomach.	I_S0
In twenty years, when the young become parents, they will care for their children's health.	I_S0
Consequently, they will spend more time to think about the manus they offer to the kids to ensure the nutritions in meals.	I_S0
On the contrary, the old idea that we just need sufficient foods will have gone in twenty years.	I_S0
For example, my cousin works as a wateress in a resturant.	I_S0
Even thogh she always feels tired and exhausted after a whole days' work, she still selects materials of cooking carefully, and prepares them thoroughly.	I_S0
As a result, I believe in twenty years, when she is forty-four years old, she will still maintain the awareness of health and enhance this idea to her kids.	I_S0
So if the cognition to stay healthy can be improved, people will take more time in cooking and preparing foods.	E_S0
Secondly, the knowledge of nutritions will be widespreaded in twenty years.	S_M1
This is because educated poeple become more and more, In this case, they will have more elements to take into account, such as the original place where the fruits or vegitable come from, the parts of cattle which is more delicious, and which kinds of foods cannot be cooked together.	B_S1
On the contrary, people nowadays have less access to these knowledge.	E_S1
So people in the future will spend more time in preparing materials.	S_C2
 
There is a view that the opinions the celebrities hold are more significant to the youth than to the old.	S_I0
Well, I agree wiht this perspective.	S_T0
For many celebrites, majority of their fans are young people who are willing to accept all the opinions from their adols.	S_M0
And with the more accessible to follow the blogs of the celebrities, young fans could keep a close track of what their adols say or do when those celebrities post their mood on blog.	B_S1
In this way, young people are very venurable to those positive or negative things that their adols deliver.	E_S1
For example, if the celebrities appeals to protect some endagered animals, the information the young fans get isthat they should pay more attention to some certain species and might do some activities to help maintain the diversity of animials or plants since they consider is as a closer connection between them and their adols by doing so.	S_M0
Hence this celebrity effect will do good to our society .	S_S2
But if some cebrities express some opinions that are not appropriate, like agitating some immoral behaviors.	S_M0
They may set a bad example for the youth fans.	B_S1
As many young people cannot tell the right from wrong , they tend to mould the celebrities behavior and thus make mistakes.	E_S1
As for older poeple, they can distinguish what is right and what is wrong as their mental function is mature.	S_M0
So they are less likely to be effected by the opinons of celebrities.	B_S0
They will just make thier own decisions by their own.	I_S0
If the celebrities say the right things, they will agree and try to mimic their activities.	I_S0
But if the celebrities are wrong, they know not to follow and tell others that is wrong.	I_S0
Therefore, they are not likely to be influenced.	E_S0
Overall, I support that the	S_S2
 
You minght say that parents are responsible for protect their children from any thing that may hurts them.	S_T1
But I think if parents let their children make mistakes and leran from it can have many benefits.	S_T0
First, it helps children learning how to release the pressure from failuer.	S_M1
As we know, when we grow up, there are many difficut circumstances are waiting for us.	B_S0
Of course, douzens of mistakes we might made.	I_S0
So it is very nessecery to learn how to deal with these dissapointment.	I_S0
When you first face to this, you will be embarrasing, but as the times increase, you will adapt it, like cry for a while, then be ok the next day.	E_S0
As for me, I forgot my assingment few times when I was in primary school.	S_M1
And I got punishment from my teacher.	B_S0
Then I remembered to make sure that I had done all the things needs to submit next day over and over.	I_S0
If my parens check my homework, these may not happen.	I_S0
But what if I have already get a job, and I fogot my work.	I_S0
The result must be desaster.	I_S0
Pepole without such experence actually make negative effects in the work place.	E_S0
Second, parents can have closer connection with their kids when they dealing the same things.	S_C2
 
I do no think people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.	B_T0
In my opion,there are following reasons.	E_T0
First,people today have less time to help the others.	S_M1
Today,we arec always busy on our way to do something.	B_S0
Thus that,we have no time to care the strangers.	I_S0
What we can do most is to call the police or doctors for help.	E_S0
In a addition.	S_M1
Nowadays,people are all afraid to help the others.	B_S0
We always hear that old man fall down on the road and says that it was the man who help him knock him down.	I_S0
So people have to think about the results after helping the strangers.	I_S0
Mot of the time,we choose to igore them or turn to the police for help.	E_S0
 
In the past  parents are always listen to their children.	B_I0
They buy anything their kids want, and when their kids make mistakes they will immediately protect their chidren, and most of kids in the past would depend on thier parents.	I_I0
Admitately it will prevent their children form hurtting or upset .	E_I0
And my brother's parents always do so because they love their chilren so much.	S_T1
Hoever I disagree with this oponion beacuse  we should go through something so that we can be stronger.	B_T0
so Agree that nowadys kids will be more indepent.	E_T0
Nowadys teenagers are takeing part in all kinds of clubs to do whatever they like.	S_M0
So they have to make inhdepend choice that which club to take, and it will make them more independ.	B_S0
Last term I did't know which club to take , I asked to my parents but they siad to me it was your bussine and you had to make your own decision.	I_S0
So I made my own decision and took part in  Eglish club.	I_S0
Of corse i made a lot of friends there and became a leader there.	I_S0
So I think nowadys people are more independ.	E_S0
With the development of teachnology people use computer to work or study, there are time limited.	S_M0
So you have to choose things fast instand of asking your parents.	B_S0
For istance Steve jobs are the father of Iphoe and  he was known for the people all around the world.	I_S0
But did you know he dropped off school to do some invention.	I_S0
You can image if he asked her parents that if he shold do this, the anser would certianlly was no.	I_S0
But he did't do so, he made his choice very quilkly so that we can have the smart phone called Iphone now.	I_S0
Time is chance, Steve got the chance!.	I_S0
And that 's the reason I think the nowadays people denpen  on thier self more.	E_S0
With the the development of the knoweldge , we have more knowledge now than before.	S_M0
So we can we always make visiabe choice that will give people a lot of condfidence to make their own choice.	B_S0
Take me as a example I used to afriad to doing anything about myself even what to eat I will asked to myParents.	I_S0
But now the siuation has changed with I grow up, I gain a lot of knowledge about social life and study.	I_S0
So I can denpend on myself.	I_S0
And I always tell my parents to eat what or where to go for the lunch.	I_S0
So that's the last the point maike me think nowadys people are more independ on their self.	E_S0
So as far as I am concered, today yountg people are better able to make decisions about their own lives than people in the past.	S_C2
 
There is an interesting question, "will you want to remove a mountain with your friends or all by yourself?"	B_I0
I believe the most of people will choose the first one, and so do I.	I_I0
However, some say that when you work alone you will get a quiet place and a relaxing time schedual, which can totally enhance your efficiency into another high level.	I_I0
In contrast, I think that team work can divide the ha=eavy assignment into piece of job, and peer pressure will force you to do hard.	E_I0
Thus, I will display them in the paragraph below.	S_T1
To begin with, when oyu are facing tons of jobs and works, team work is the perfect choice for you to release much pressure.	S_M1
As we all know, it is hard to eat all favor in one dinner table, and a lot of people can quickly solve it in few minutes.	B_S0
For example, once I need to deal with a heavy workload from my math teather, then I was stopped by a difficult question which wasted plenty of my time.	I_S0
After that, Icalled some of my friends to come to my home and help me to overcome them.	I_S0
We divided the homework into many parts, which means everyone just need to solve a little questions.	I_S0
In this way, we immediately finished our job.	I_S0
In conclution, team work is imprtant factor for us to do that job.	E_S0
In addition, your classmates can be some supervisors to force you to focus on your job.	S_M1
Compared to team work, individual can easily be distracted by other thing that can low their efficiency of assignments.	B_S0
When it comes to team work, this circumstance can not exist.	I_S0
For instance, when you feel so tired to do some projects,and you want to play some digital game, you can see all your classmates are concentrating on their own work.	I_S0
Will you still want to do that thing?	I_S0
Thus, team work can help to improve the efficiency in a special way.	E_S0
Although some think that parents also can be a supervisor to make you focus your job when you are alone.	B_C0
Nevertheless, they donot absolutely realize how much of you homework really is like classmates do, because they have the same assignment as you.	I_C0
Hence when you lie you have finished you job, they can just trust you.	I_C0
So this way is not work.	E_C0
 
I disagree with with the following statement.	S_T1
from my perspective, people in the past are as same as people today willing to help the struggling strangers, even people in the past are more wram-hearted than people today.	B_S0
For example,when the olds falling down, most people today will chose to ingnore it because they are afraid of the olds will ask them to response for it.	I_S0
on the contury, people in the past didn't have such this problem.	I_S0
Some voice said that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers, the reason may be people today have more money to help syruggling strangers, but number of people who help the struggling strangers may less than the past.	I_S0
And nowadays,people become more and more afraid to helping each other.	I_S0
Because the more they help, the more risk and responsebility they will have.	I_S0
Meanwhile, people in the past shouldn't consider as much as people today.	I_S0
All in all, I disagree that people today are more willing to help struggling strangers, they are more afraid of helping people.	E_S0
 
Nowedays, whatever goverment or civilians, they always pay more attention on the educations of universities.	S_I0
This is because a good education will have an important influence on students.	B_T0
In the process of education, professors play an important role.	E_T0
Thus I think giving professors more welfare is necessary.	S_T1
First, if professor can obtain more benefits from their work, they would like treat their work seriesly.	S_M1
We can imagine, if we were professor, we work hard everyday, but we cannot obtain the benefits that we should receive.	B_S0
In that case, most people will feel upset and angry, they will lose their passion about working or the worse situation is those teacher will quit their work.	I_S0
If schools cannot cope with situation well, students will be effected by it, because they have got to receive the unideal education.	I_S0
If this situations maintain a long term, the reputaion of school will be destoried, and students will not be willing to go to school.	E_S0
Second, if professor can obtain more salaries, they can usa these money to do some research, then they can give students better education.	S_M1
For example, in the past time, my sister is a junior students in school, her major is astonomy.	B_S0
One day, they studied a new planets, but everyone still cannot understand its structure even through the text book.	I_S0
The solution is very easy, they just need a telescope.	I_S0
However, the school telescope is broken, it needed to wait a long time to use it.	I_S0
And professor cannot afford it, because their salary is not high.	I_S0
Then the sckool knew about this thing, in order to solve it, school add money to professor's salary.	I_S0
Thus, professor use these money to buy a telescope.	I_S0
They use it to observe the planet everyday.	I_S0
When they figure out its structure, they tell students they specific conditions.	I_S0
In the end, students can master this knowledge.	E_S0
Finally, if professor can obtain more money, they will have appreciation for this school, so school can have a steady number of teachers.	B_C0
If professor do not like the welfare of this school, they would like to find another job that have better welfare.	I_C0
Therefore, some the best teachers will leave the school.	I_C0
If school lose these elites, they result is very feasible.	E_C0
Those teachers in most case is liked by s	O
 
When it comes to an ordinary problem whether we should interupt and correct the mistake of our teachers or meeting leaders right away in the classroom or in the meeting, different people hold distinctive views about it.	S_T1
Some agrees that we should correct it immediately to ensure everything goes on well while others may think it is better to wait until the calss or meeting is ober and the people are gone, and then talk to the teacher or meeting leader about the mistake.	S_T0
Even someone prefers to sating nothing.	S_T1
From my perspective, I am for the second resolution.	S_T0
First, the teacher or the meeting leader may feel awkward to be interrupted in front of so many people.	S_M0
Showing respect to the lecturers who thrived to make the lecture rich, meaningful and articulate is really important and necessary.	B_S0
If we stand on their shoes, imagining that we are the one standing on the stage to give a  speech, in which most of the words should be recited in advance, and the errors should be aboided as much as possible.	I_S0
How stressed the lectuter is!	I_S0
Therefore, it is totally a bad idea to put up the problem directly to make the lecturer feel guilty and nervous.	I_S0
We should just write down what we want to correct, and keep silence for a minute to encourage the lecturer finish the whole lecture in his mind.	E_S0
Second, raising hand and sharply pointing out the mistake can not only interfere the teacher or the meeting leader, but also will distract the audiences by arousing their attention.	S_M0
Audience would be goning to focus on the wrong thing disussed by the lecturer rather than the main point that he indeed wants to convey, which is a shame and not fair to all the ones who concentarated on the speech before.	B_S1
Hence, I insist that we should not instantly have the highlight on ourselves to show off that we are clever enough to find the mistake of others, instead, to show trust on others and believe that all others are also reflectiong on their questions about the lecture and do not disturb them.	E_S1
Third, holding the question as well as waiting for later discussion may contribute to a superb opportunity to have a deeper and futher vonversation wuth extraordinaty leader or experienced and expert teacher without anyone distraction or time limited, either, since the class or the meeting has expored.	S_M0
There does exist the chance taht we had a wrong jufgment about whether the lecturer made a mistake for the lack of time fiven into thinking in the lecture.	S_S2
To conclude, the second choice makes both the lecturer and the auduences comfortable and being respected, and also give ourselves a chane to have s second thought, which is the reason why I high recommend everyone to take this choice when they are in this situation.	S_C2
 
In my opinion, this statement can actually has two sodes to discuss.	B_T1
Firstly, sometimes parents can't let children to make mistakes , since the word "mistakes " dosen't  represent  a  clear meaning.	I_T1
To be more clear, the ‘mistakes" can be really little that dosen't really matter a lot, even  dosen't affect  childrens ' life.	E_T1
as an example, the child broke the window of the house, when he's playing soccer,  parents rebuke him even the child had apologied and the child gets upset about  that.	B_S0
In this way, children may feel unfair that parents even never understand them, as a result, the relationship between children and parents might  froze al llittle.	I_S0
In a word, if the mistakes didn't affect childrens' personnality and life , there's no need to force them to learn a lesson , just let children  go , they will find out their mistakes as time goes.	E_S0
Secendly, if the mistakes turn to be serious that affect childrens' life  and if  the  mistakes is not corrected right awy , there will happen a really serious result.	S_M2
For example, when the child stole other students' stuff, but he apologies about that as well, parents should take action .	B_S0
It's because the stolen action should have a reason, while broke other's window should be a accident.	I_S0
I f the parents don't get to know the reson then the child will keep stealing for that reson.	E_S0
In conclusion, whether parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes depends on how serious or heavy the "mistakees" are ,if not serious, they willget to know that as time passes by , parents don't have to break their relationships ; if the "mistakes' are heavy , parents should take action or children will not learn from their own mistakes until next heavier mistakes.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, there is a popular awarding policy among parents and their school-age children, which is the kids can get awarding money for each high grade they get in school.	B_I0
Different people hold different opinions on it.	E_I0
Some people think it's good for motivation, but some think it does harm to children's growth because they are actually supressed to study hard, which is not voluntarily.	S_T0
As for me, I think it will be a great idea only if parents run the awarding system in the right way.	S_T1
On the one hand, children will become more hard-working if they know they can get some awards as soon as they get good grades in schools.	S_M1
It is common that there is always something which kids want to buy but can't realize because of the lack of pocket money.	B_S0
Therefore, the excess awarding money will become a great motivation for them.	I_S0
They are more willing to concentrate on the class and finish the homework on time to get the better grades, and then to buy their dream present by their own.	E_S0
On the other hand, to some extent, this kind of awarding policy will give the kids some wrong assumptions about studying because it seems as they are just studying for money and for their favorate gifts.	S_M1
Therefore, it is not difficult to image that once they get enough pocket money to buy all the things they want, they will stop studying hard then.	B_S0
That's why choosing a right way to offer award money is so crucial.	I_S0
As far as I am concerned, parents should set a serious of detailed standards to make the awarding system more realizable.	I_S0
More imporotant, the system should be based on the progress their kids make compared to the formal semester rather than the certain grades they get in the current semester.	I_S0
For example, it will be more wisdom in this: one dollar for every five more scores you get compares to the last examination.	I_S0
This kind of standard can always provide the children best motivations and keep them concentrate on studying all the time.	E_S0
In short, there is no doubt that offering school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a good way to motivate kids.	B_C1
However, its result is depends on the right methods and standards parents used.	E_C1
 
In my opinion, offer school-age children money for their high score is not a good idea.	S_T0
First, school-age children are still on their way to observe the world and learn from it.	S_M1
They do not have stable point of view to the world.	B_S0
They are easily influenced by people around them, for instance, their parents.	I_S0
Appreciating children for their high mark by giving them money could probably lead them to consider that their good behavior should always be reward, which is not true.	I_S0
Then if one day, these children grow up, they have to fight for their own living, and nobody has the responsibility to offer award for their hardworking on their own lives, they might get hurt or loose confidence.	I_S0
Not to consider the children's future, the school life could also hard for them.	I_S0
They would study for their parents' money, not for learning knowledge.	E_S0
Maybe school-age children do need some award for their outstanding performance at school to encourage them keeping up their good work, however, offering money is not a good option.	S_M1
Most school-age children do not have ability that is strong enough for them to spend the money appropriately.	B_S0
When I was in primary school, my deskmate had the problem to use and control his award money.	I_S0
Once he got a 90 on his science test, his parents gave him 50 RMBs.	I_S0
When I went back to my seat, I found a grasshopper on my desk.	I_S0
My deskmate told me he bought it from another student using all of the 50 RMBs.	I_S0
I was quite shocked at the time I knew this.	I_S0
This kind of examples are actually pretty common among the school-age children.	E_S0
In short, Ioffer school-age children money for their high score is not a good idea.	S_C2
 
Do you remember the last time when your family members help you with the difficulties you met and encourage you to be more hard-working?	B_I0
Many people hold the point of view that the help from one's family is essential to one's life.	E_I0
From my perspective, I'm persuaded that this kind of help made a person to be more likely to success nowadays because it's more powerful and more frequent when compared to the past.	S_T0
Firstly, parents show more consideration on their children's education.	S_M1
Do you remember the angry expressions on your parents' faces when they knew that you got a low score from the examination?	B_S0
It's common sense that parents are being much more concerned about their children's score in school.	I_S0
However, this kind of situation was rarely happened to your parents.	I_S0
In the past, what the parents of your father or mother mostly cared about whether they can support the whole family owing to the low economic level at that time.	I_S0
They would be satisfied if they can let all the family members have enouth food to eat.	I_S0
On account of this situation, they would care not that much about the education of their children.	I_S0
So the different concentration level would result in the different education level, and that would make people nowadays easier to success.	E_S0
Moreover, family nowadays can provide much stronger help than the past.	S_M1
With the develpment of the society, the thing that people can do changed a lot.	B_S0
For example, if your dream is to be a good pilot.	I_S0
The thing you need to achieve your dream is to accept professional pilot training lesson and fly enough hours in planes.	I_S0
Let's suppose that you were born in the 1960s, in a middle class family in China.	I_S0
The most possible situation you would be confronted with when you tell your father that you want to be a pilot is that he scold you to be practical and let you help with the family chores.	I_S0
Nevertheless, if you were born in the 2000s, still in a middle class family in China.	I_S0
Your parents may be happy about your dream and send you to a pilot school when you get older.	I_S0
As the instancde has illustrated, family can provide you with stronger help, and this kind of help can make it much more possible for you to succeed.	E_S0
 
In modern society, it is common that everyone has to work five days a week.	B_I0
A week is devided into two parts for a long time.	I_I0
One is weekdays and the other is weekends.	I_I0
Maybe the tradition comes from the Bible, I think.	I_I0
From my prespective, I think work only three days a week for long hours is not a bad choice.	E_I0
In this way, I can have more spare time which can be distributed by myself.	S_T0
With the four days off, I can develop my own hobby and do whatever I want.	S_M0
You know, today more and more people are complaining about the lack of their own time.	B_S0
I agree that this work form is a fantastic solution of that problem.	I_S0
As for me, I have  been bothered by the arrangement of our class a lot.	I_S0
We have to go to classes every day but they only engage one or two parts of the day's scheduel.	I_S0
The soluted arrange separates my whole time and it is difficult for me to do something large.	I_S0
For example, if there is only an afternoon blank in the middle, what I can do is only stay in my dorm reading some books.	I_S0
The plan of having a hiking or traveling by myself is postponed day by day.	E_S0
In addition, it is a waste for people who have ability to finish work in a short time.	S_M0
Many company has the rule which forbid people leaving until the leaving time.	B_S1
But if we have finished what we should do before the time, the waiting is not valuable.	E_S1
Admittedly, the five days working form is good for our health because we can have a relax routine and there will be less pressure for workers.	S_M0
I contend that we can have the other choice because we are so young to adapt that pressure.	S_S2
In a word, both forms are nice, but i want to c	S_C2
 
I think it is better to relax by watching a movie or resding a book than relax by doing physical exercise .	S_T1
for example watching a movie and reading abook is too normal in our life .	B_S0
but doing physical exercise need piace ro do that .	I_S0
second  the most  young people like watching a movie or reading a book than doing physical exercise.	I_S0
ahd than ,it is easy to take abook than take a basketball.	I_S0
Some girls every mouth have some day is not convenience to take a physical exercise .	I_S0
in my attantion i think watching a movie is more intersting than doing a physical exercise.	E_S0
 
As an old saying goes:"There generations cultivate a gentleman."	B_I0
Success needs accumulation of experience.	I_I0
People ask whether children should do the similar jobs as their parents.	I_I0
In my opinion, the tradition of a family is carried on generation by generation.	I_I0
And the story can be found from different oppucations.	E_I0
So, it is better for children to choose jobs akin to their parents.	S_T0
There are at least three aspects of advatage for the similar career choose.	S_S2
The first aspect is the skills and experience a certain career needs.	S_M1
If children Parents have stepped ahead for  more than 20s years than the younger generation.	B_S0
In the begining of the child's career pursuing, he can learn a lot from the familiar teacher and leader--his father or mother.	I_S0
Once he face some trouble in job or in career-relevant life, he can consult to the teacher whenever he needs.	I_S0
For instance, I have a high-school classmate, who became a civil servant as his father did.	I_S0
His father paved the way for his early career and he can settle his professional life as soon as he graduated from university.	I_S0
How to take part in the tests, how to prepare the interview, all these information and skills he can coached by his father easily.	E_S0
The second aspect is the accumulaton of the soft skills.	S_M1
People are not born to be talent.	B_S0
Some kinds of jobs need generations of accumulation, like doing business.	I_S0
Business man need negationation wisdom, broaden horizon of eyesights and acute sense of opportunities.	I_S0
Some famous business man came out from business families.	I_S0
With generations' experience to distinguish good chance from bad, they can make the cost dowm and hold the risk affordable.	I_S0
Success become a group job.	I_S0
Two heads are always better than one.	I_S0
Even my father has given my a lot of teaching wisdom about how to draw my students' attention.	I_S0
By the way, share the same interest with my father feels good.	E_S0
The last aspect is the platform which are warmed by parents.	B_C0
The chance is so important for a youngster.	I_C0
Only if there are chances, the successful story can have earth to happen.	I_C0
My uncle followed his mother to do business since he was a common high shool  students.	E_C0
There is a stable channel for him to try his sale strategies, with the guidence of his mother and their friends on business.	B_S1
So, without doubt, he became a successful saleman and established his own business later.	E_S1
 
What kind of work is meaningfull and worth the time and efforts that workers spend?	B_I0
Some people prefer doing similar tasks for a long time or even as the career goal while others argue that different types of tasks  should be the right choice.	E_I0
As far as i am concerned, the later opinion is more resonable and ought to be widely accepted.	S_T0
Undoubtly, a variouty of tasks offers workers more sense of refreshment which can greatly help them to work with more passion and motivation.	S_M1
Always geting involved in tasks in the categories without differences could make people bored and even no longer motivated because of the satisfaction from the already familared opration.	B_S0
Take ITers as an example, it they are required to keep designing the same kind of applications or softwares without new creation,  they might feel meaningless and even get lost in their career.	I_S0
Consequently, they will choose to leave the ompany or even chang their job.	E_S0
Admittedly, sense of achievement is one of the most impotant inspiration for individuels especially during the posecess of chasing career goals.	S_M1
Although it does make sense that  "practice makes perfect", overbless into one single kind of task limited people to develop their potential, as a resault, the fully development and self-building would be negatively impacted.	B_S1
Dealing with changable tasks offers people more opptunities to chanllenge themselves and also fullfill their ablities so that to make progress and gain improvements which is of vital impotance to their career life.	E_S1
Take all the reasons mentioned above in to consideration,  having man	O
 
I disagree with that statement.	S_I0
You see that,watching a movie or reading a book are both activities which are taken indoors while you are sitting on a chair,I don't think that's what modern citizens need most for relaxing after a long day of working.	S_T1
First,it is a big problem that people tend to become overweight with modern lifestyle,one of the most important reason is    the lack of exercise.	S_M2
Sitting and eating snacks might only help people accumulate more fat.	B_S0
Second,what people really need is confidence of thier life.	I_S0
Reading or watching a movie are quite easy for us,and the leisure goes with the memory.	I_S0
But exercising benifits us for a long run,as long as we see the change of our body and become trully happy.	E_S0
 
Nowadays,many parents hold the belief that their school-age children should be offered money for each high grade they get.	S_T1
But actually I don't think it's a good idea,mainly because it's useless for the further studing.	S_T0
Coming to this topic,one of my best friends' story will be the best example to support my view.	S_M2
When he was in the primary school,his mother had always inspired him with money after final exams.	B_S0
Not only did his mom use the money to praise his high grades,but also she wanted to inspire him to study more harder by this way.	I_S0
But unfortunately,he didn't want to study any more unless his parents offered him enough money after he went to the middle school.	E_S0
that's why	S_S2
 
With increasing intense competition among the children, their education plays a crucial role in their parents' mind.	B_I0
Some parents attempt to create some methods to encourage their children to study harder.	I_I0
Recently, the phenomenon that parents are willing to give some money as a reward to their children for a high grade in the school has caused a wide concern.	E_I0
Some people critize this method because it could cause a negetive influence on children's growth.	S_T0
However, I maintain the opposites view that giving some money to children as a reward is a positve choice, compared with its drawbacks.	S_S2
To start with, giving some money as a reward to their children can stimulate children to study harder.	S_M1
Certainly, we can't deny that sometimes study is considered a boring and repeated task, such as reading the book, solving math problems, and listening the records.	B_S0
These feedbacks are able to change children's attitude to study from a boring task to a attractive job, as well as keep a continuing interest of study.	I_S0
Using these money to buy some gifts they prefer is also attractve for them, isn't it?	E_S0
In addition, it is necessary for children to establish a healthy attitude to efforts and feedbacks, feedbacks would not come back until substantial efforts have been made.	S_M1
This concept could benifits children not only at present but also in the future.	B_S0
For instanse, when they graduate and work in a company, they concentrate on the task itself first, rather than the feedback.	I_S0
They usually have a better behavior and would obtain more chances of promotion.	E_S0
Indeed, it is unaceptable to give too much money to children once a time, which would change children's intention of study even make them seek for just one thing, money.	B_C0
Nevertheless, when we make sure children have established a healthy and completed attitude to money, it will be fine to do so.	I_C0
Accoding to the reasons explained above, I must highlight my opinion that it is good for parents to give some money as a reward to their children for each high mark in the school.	E_C0
 
Nowadays, more and more complaints about the children's education are full with every kinds of mass media.	B_I0
Some people including some educational experts hold a view  that children spend so much time in doing homework and participating in activities related to school and sports that they can't have spare time to do what they want to do.	E_I0
However, as far as I am concerned, this phenomenon is totally correct and there is no need to change it.	S_T0
Here are some reasons to support my view.	S_T1
First of all, children are still very young and they can't control themselves very well.	S_M0
The society is full of danger and temptations and due to the lack of plenty social experience and the chidish character, children will be trapped in trouble.	B_S0
If children are allowed to do what they what to do at their willings, they may lose their goals and get addicated to some harmful things.	I_S0
Besides, they are more likely to do some illegal crimes.	I_S0
Take my cousin as an example.	I_S0
My uncle and aunt were busy with their work and didn't have time to spend with him, which caused the truth that my cousin used to play computer games in the spare time.	I_S0
Graduall, he became so addicted to it that his scores was also lower and lower.	I_S0
He had to drop out of school and make a living by himself.	E_S0
Secondly, the homework and activities are not extremely useless.	S_M0
The homework can help children master the knowledge they have learned.	B_S0
What's more, the activities will help them develop their interest and build strong bodies.	I_S0
It is very necessary for school to orgnize these activities.	I_S0
Some children might enjoy eating ice-cream or watching TV at home.	I_S0
These activities are not beneficial for them.	I_S0
For instance, my sister once pacticed dance for a class picnic, and she fell in love with dance after that.	E_S0
Third, although for the kids' freedom and all-around development, it is time for us to be not stirct to them, we are also willing to make sure that they can grow up very heathily and live a happy life during their childhood.	S_M0
So I agree with this	S_S2
 
Do you feel upset this when the deadline is coming but your work have not done?	S_T1
If your anwser is yes, please consider the problem whether you make a work plan or obey it.	B_S1
Lots of people think the fact that is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize because modern life is very complex.	E_S1
However, it is significant to make the order to everything for people to accomplish their work, no matter the modern society is complex or not.	S_T1
People should manege their time by making plan and	S_S2
 
With the development of the socioty and science, we can get a bigger amount of information than before.	B_T1
The television is an very importent way to provide information.	I_T1
So for the states we shouid not to give chlidren to watch the adertising is very rigid,and i do not agree with it.	E_T1
Because tevevision advertising could borden the horizon of the children and teach them a lot useful skills.	B_S1
The most importent is they are appealed by the advertising and stimulate the intresting of them.	E_S1
First, tevevision advertising could bring a lot of information to the children, by this way they could know more about outdoor world.	S_M2
Children of age of two to five are very easy to get hurt.	B_S0
they may do something indoor activities.	I_S0
So they may watch tv and the advertising is can not to avoid.	I_S0
However the advertising includ a lot of tecnoledge.	I_S0
For example an  advertising of a cake is about a famous story from chinese culture.	I_S0
It is tell a story that when the people miss the hometown that is far away from them, they will eat this cake	E_S0
 
These days, there is a hot topic: whether the extra time squeezed by busy parents should be used to play games or sports with kids of be used to do things which are related to schoolwork.	B_I0
The answers vary from people to people.	E_I0
Some people think that parents need to use that time to do things together which has things to do with schoolwork.	S_T0
Contrary to their views comes my opinion that it is necessary for busy parents to use that extra time to play sports or games with their children.	S_T1
To begin with, playing games or sports together can boost their family bones.	S_M1
It is acknowledged that playing games and sports is the best way to get relaxed.	B_S0
In this case, children would not feel underpressure when they get along with their parents, so they enjoy their parents' accompany, which can help to improve their family relationship.	I_S0
By contrast, doing schoolwork together is a tough thing, since it is hard for parents to teach school work in a humorous way.	I_S0
Finally their children will feel stressed out with their parents.	I_S0
Take myself as an example, my parents are very busy.	I_S0
They always use their spare time to play games with me or take a walk with me.	I_S0
During the sports and games time, we can talk together sharing our emotional problems or interesting experiences which occured in school or workplace.	I_S0
We can talk so much that we all have no secrets to each other, so we are in good relationship till now.	E_S0
Moreover, playing sports or games together can help to cultivate good qualities to children: Persistence.	S_M1
To be specific, playing sports can help children improve their patience and persistence with a good instruction.	B_S0
With parents supervision and encourage, children can persist in things when they meet tough things.	I_S0
My experience is also a good case.	I_S0
I felt hard when I learned to swim, but with my parents accompany, I need to keep practice it.	I_S0
It is their encourage and supports that helps me learn to be persistent to the problem.	E_S0
In general,	S_S2
 
I do think it is a good idea.	B_T1
Firstly,as a kind of award for their kids,money will encourage the children to study harder.	I_T1
Because if parents do this,their kids will think that their effect counts.	I_T1
They may know that their hard-working will make both their parents and themselvies happy.	E_T1
When I was a child,once I got two 100 marks in both my Chinese exam and my math exam in a final examination.	B_S0
My parents are so glad that they give me 100 RMB to encourage me.	I_S0
Their encouragement really change me a lot.	I_S0
From then on,I study harder,not only to get more money,but also to make the whole family delighted.	E_S0
Secondly,offerring school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a good way to teach them how to use their money.	S_M2
parents can tell their kids that it is their hard working that make them have the money.	B_S1
And for this reason,they cannot ask their parents for money if they do nothing.	E_S1
 
In China, an arm of parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.	S_I0
In my opinion, it has bad influnce concerned with their children's future.	S_T0
On top of that, on one hand, it gives the chidren the courage to study hard and work for hours, on the other hand, it also lets the children have the emotion of money and maybe be a person who dose everything for money.	S_M2
First, the children will be interested in studying when it offers to the money.	B_S0
However, is it from the children's mind?	I_S0
The children are not interested in stduying but in the money, which can give him quantities of profits when studying well.	I_S0
In a short time, we can see it helps the children work harder than the past, but it is not a manner that can improve his interests in learning and not good for his long-time studying in the future.	I_S0
In addition, it not only makes him get dependent on the profits that the money gives them, but also they can not study if he does not need the amount of money.	I_S0
Once the situation is present, the children have the possibility to tell their parents that they will not study hard again if they don't give them enough money to play.	I_S0
What's more, it is possible that the children may use the money to do something harmful for them, which will have a great bad impact on their lives.	I_S0
Please the parents think what will you do if your children will be that kind of people?	I_S0
Moreover, there are a lot of solutions to solving the problems which can help the children study hard not to use the money.	I_S0
For example, you can tell the importance of studying, such as earning money and becoming more smarter than they are now.	I_S0
What's more, you can give how the great people in the history study to push him improve.	I_S0
Last but not least, you are supposed to tell him remember that only can what you study be forever for you.	E_S0
All parents love their children but please be attention for the education that belong to your children which will be a large influence	O
 
Nowadays, people live in a big world and they should relate with others.	S_T1
someone says that people can not live alone.	B_S0
As time goes by  Firstly, when we were children, teacher tought us we should help people in trouble.	I_S0
the teaching is always influent us.	I_S0
Secondly,	I_S0
Fanilly,	I_S0
In conclution, peiple are more want to help other	E_S0
 
I have two itimates, one of my friend like to reading book, so we always call her a bookworm.	B_I0
I can clearly remember that she told me she had read a hundreds of books.	I_I0
And another friend of mine has many hobbies such as watching TV, surf on the Internet or listen to radio,etc.	I_I0
So he has many approaches to get a lot of information.	E_I0
Finally, a knowledge competition reveal the fact that he that get news from many different ways won.	S_T0
Therefore, I have the profound conviction that people must get information from various avenues.	S_T1
First of all, many different news sources will broaden our horizons, so we can get a complete understanding of one specific incident.	S_M0
For instance, my brother was the monitor of his class and he as his class representative to participated in an activity called Entering Our Life.	B_S0
So he was supposed to do survey and gain a lot of knowledge for the purpose that to be weill-informed and become the top student of the activity.	I_S0
Therefore, he looked over encyclopedia and asked his teachers for help in order to gain wild information.	I_S0
Eventually, he stood out among whole the students on account of a rich of knowledge that from diverse sources.	E_S0
On top of that, referring to numerous reference is a favourable opportunity for individuals to become erudite.	S_M0
It dose not surprise us to discover that many news sources can give people a comprehensive and overall perspective to realize affair.	B_S0
To illustrate, many young people are prone to surf the web and scan other's comments to determine an essence of affair.	I_S0
In fact, these approach is not reasonale because people will accept extremely narrow information, and could not figure out the truth.	I_S0
Consequently, it is impossible for these poeple to be knowledgeable.	E_S0
Adimittedly, it is true that if people are preoccupied with simple one source, they will pay more attention and only focus on it.	S_M0
Therefore, they can get a deep insight of this.	B_S1
However, it is likely that the source is not really right or true, so people who fouces on this will go astray way to reaching the ultimate outcome.	E_S1
To put all into a nutshell, I strongly believe that it is nucessary for people to get information from different new sources because it can broaden their horizon	S_C2
 
I agree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.	S_T0
Not only owing to my personal life experience,many friends of mine provide examples.	S_T1
First of all,there is no doubt that watching a movie or reading a book is more acceptable to people.	S_M1
Even the old people can relax by it easily.	B_S0
You don't need to use your muscle to run or jump,only eyes and brains needed.	I_S0
Those who are busy at work and don't have time to the gym can use their fragmented time on movies or books.	E_S0
Secondly,movies or books can provide us with various feelings such as happiness,sadness and excitement.	S_M1
There are enormous kinds of movies and books which offer different feelings to stimulate the brains.	B_S0
Some excellent works even give you fresh knowledge and inspirations.	I_S0
On the contrary,doing physical exercise only effects your muscle.	I_S0
The stimulation is limited.	E_S0
In my point of view,watching a movie or reading a book gives us a longer effect than doing physical exercise.	S_C2
The latter does help your body grow and eventually make you a healthy body,but it alsoc accompanies bitterness.	S_S2
Therefore,I think movies and boo	O
 
Wether doing the assignments alone or in groups is a simple personal question.	B_I0
Some prefer to finish the assign projects by themselve while others are pretending to have the work done by the group form.	E_I0
As for my perspective, I strongly agree that doing the group work will be more efficiency and effective.	S_T0
First of all, when people is doing the group work, there is no doubt that there is no chance for anyone be absent in mind.	S_M0
It is difficult for us to think the usless things under the watching over by others.	B_S0
Take my experience as an example, there was a time when I was poor in math.	I_S0
I always feel absenting in mind,while I was doing the math homework alone.	I_S0
Then my teacher asked some students in my class to study with me in group.	I_S0
It was that time that I start to feel a great improving in math due to be watched over by other members of our group.	I_S0
If there were any one to study with me, I would never get over   this problem.	I_S0
From this case, it is easy to conclude that the group work is easy for us to concentrate what we are doing now.	E_S0
What's more, group work also makes us improving quickly.	S_M0
During the mindstorm, we can learn more about others better idea and use them.	B_S0
There is no better fact proves this opinion than in the most international corprations, the engeneers are always work in groups.	I_S0
Therefore, they get more progress better in a shorter time.	I_S0
That is why most of the people prefer to have the work done in the group form.	I_S0
They do the same amount of things, while achived a higher goal.	E_S0
Last but not least, the group work also bring us with happiness.	S_M0
When doing the group work, we seldom feel longly or get bored cause the accompany with the fellows.	B_S0
For instance, in my collage, during the class we always have great fun to do the group works.	I_S0
If we always deal them alone, it is easy for us to get sleepy and tired.	E_S0
According to what has been discussed above, we can safely come to the conclusion that the teachers assign projects on students must work together will be definitely more efficiency and the students themselves are supposed to learn more during the group work.	S_C2
 
I think the behavior that parents offer school-age children money for high grade is understandble and it may give a encouragement to their child to get a higher grade next time.	B_I0
It is known to everyone that the grade children get in school is important and grade is a fair method to evaluate a student.	I_I0
So as the grade is significant, parents should try more to encourage them.	E_I0
I would give following reasons to illustrate my opinion.	S_T0
First, money is a direct reward for student and it is very necessary for everyone.	S_M0
I have two neighbors whose kids are at the same age.	B_S0
One of them, a cute girl, was awarded by money everytime she gets a good grade.	I_S0
The other one, a clever boy, was not.	I_S0
However, as they grow up, the girl is more and more excellent but the boy gets to be indrawn and even can't catch up with his classmates.	I_S0
I was asked to talk with the little boy.	I_S0
Surprisingly, the boy told me that "When we were young, everytime the girl gets a good grade, her mother would give her pocket money, but I never get any prizes.	I_S0
I think those money are a signal of adimt"  I told his parents this words and they dropped in silence.	I_S0
It is important to show the children that I see your efforts and offering money is really a direct way.	E_S0
Secondly, it is better to develop the school-age children a sence that"you can own money by yourself if you get good grade."	S_M0
Meanwhile, they will understant the saying" Every efforts deserve a repay" better.	B_S0
After they become a undergraduate student, they will have many chances to own a scholarship.	I_S0
It is a good way to develop their sence when they were young.	I_S0
As for me, I know that I can get money if I get high grade when I was young so I own many scholarships in the university.	I_S0
But many of my classmates didn't get ready so they didn't study hard in the spare time.	I_S0
Therefore, they never have experience to get money.	E_S0
Thirdly, parents can observe what will the children do with the money.	S_M0
If they use money to buy games or go to sufur the Internet, parents can stop them.	B_S0
But if they store their money and learn financing, maybe they will become a business man in the future.	I_S0
At least they will learn how to deal with money.	E_S0
In a word,it is definetly not a bad thing to offer money to children if they get high grade.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, transportation becomes a serious problem in many countries, meanwhile, more and more people can not live with out the network.	S_T1
But when asked which one is more important to improve, people often show an air of uncertainty.	S_T0
As far as I am concerned, the transportation improvement is extremely urgent.	S_T1
Firstly, with the population booms in 21st century, more families have more than one car.	S_M1
China Daily shows that two third cities in China have much more car than the public transportation can undertake.	B_S0
Over ninty per cent Chinese have to bear the crowded and awful road circumstance.	I_S0
So if the government attaches more importance on improving public transportation, people's rates of happiness will increase a lot, which really benefis their satisfication of the government.	E_S0
What is more, more and more people choose pubic transportation to go to work,  the quality and quantity of vehicles show be paid more attention.	S_M1
No one likes to take a bus full of people.	B_S0
The data from the Economist shows less than 10 per cent people are willing to choose public transportation without comfortable environment.	I_S0
Such as my parents, they buy a car because they bear enough of cramming onto the bus crowded with people after waiting a long time .	E_S0
As to Internet access,on the one hand, the speed of Internet access nowadays is fast enough.	B_C0
Internet access improvement means old equipments' abandonment.	I_C0
It costs a lot.	I_C0
On the other hand, more and more youth are so engaged in surfing the Internet, that they ignore the importance of reality and family.	I_C0
Spending more on improving it may make the situation worse.	E_C0
 
With the growing development of tourism, there is a inescapable question for the government to settle: whether the financial support should be given to draw more attention from the tourists to promote the tourism.	B_I0
Some people state government should raise the safety of the city by hiring more police.	I_I0
Others think the appearance of the old infrastucture should be improven as well.	I_I0
I agree and insist that only when the city's saftey is ensured and the appearance is embellished can more tourists be drawn there.	I_I0
Here come my statements.	E_I0
Firstly, the a safer  environment establishes a good reputation for the city and naturally attract more people to come.	S_M2
When people decide where to spend their vocation, the fist and foremost element is the safety there.	B_S0
People have felt lacked of safety when they are far away from home.	I_S0
Therefore, they cannot persvade themselve to choose a pooly safe place to have their enjoyable holiday.	I_S0
Also, a dangerous city  shows the unqualified development, which may indicate the lacking in service and shallow people here.	I_S0
People tend to make use of their vacation to get relaxed and let themselves temporarily forgot the troubles they are in when ordinarily at work.	I_S0
Obviously, they are not willing to get into more troubles when experiening the holiday.	I_S0
Take myself for example.	I_S0
When I choose where to go in summer vacation, regularly I avoid visiting unsafe cities because I know my parents won't allow me to travel alone, which is too dangerous to go individually in such disordered enviroment.	I_S0
Of course They won't visit there themselves as well.	I_S0
For a city, the most powerful period of attracting people is in students' holiday.	I_S0
Therefore, I suggest the city should hire more police to make sure a safe envrionment.	E_S0
Moreover, improving the apperance of the city is also an efficient method of drawing attraction from others.	B_C1
Nowadays, many official tourisim agency will take pictures for many beautiful sceneries and update them on line for visitors to appericiate, which has successfully appeals to many visitors when they hasn't decided yet where to go.	E_C1
Also, people like to enter some social platforms to see the shared pictures by their friends.	S_S2

I disagree that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.	B_T0
In my opinion, we all have our own ways to relax,and we can not easily say that this way is better than the other.	I_T0
Different people have different habits, so we need to find the most suitable way for ourselves rather than the best way which said by other person.	E_T0
For example, someone used to relax by doing physical exercise,because he/she lkes playing sports.	S_M2
Maybe he/she thinks that he/she can easily fall in sleep after exercise so that he/she can get the best relaxing.	B_S0
But others don not think so, they would rather have a good rest just like watching a movie or reading a book than do some exercise.	I_S0
Maybe doing exercise make them more tired.	I_S0
So how we can straightly say that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise?	I_S0
Therefore,we just need to find the most suitable way for ourselves to relax.	E_S0
All in all, I can not support that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.	S_C2
Maybe I can relax by doing physical exercise ,and you can not.	B_S1
However, it is associated with everyone's habits.	E_S1
There is no the best way to relax, and there is only the suitable way to relax for  every	O
 
when i was in a bad mood, i love to do some physical exercise, after the end of exercise,i will be very tired.	S_T1
it will soon enter the dreamland.	B_S0
when i am not in a good mood before, i will go running, crazy run.	I_S0
but now, i like play basketball or stay in the gym, will not stop to practice, because i will get from the vent, i will feel better.	E_S0
 
Even you are a genius, it is unavoidable that you'll meet some trouble in your class.	B_I0
Maybe sometimes you tried so hard but your grade cannot go higher than a B-, or you've got full credit on every assignments and quizzes but still failed on your unit test.	I_I0
When it comes to how to get help for a class, different students hold different opinions.	E_I0
While some may think getting help from the top student in class is the best way to go, I think that getting help from a professional tutor is a more sensable choice because of the following reasons.	S_T1
A professional tutor is well-educated academically.	S_M1
They have at least a decent college diploma in order to be varified to tutor others.	B_S0
Therefore, a tutor has a lot more knowledge than a top student in class.	I_S0
A tutor can answer a lot of questions that even a top student cannot answer on your homework or tests.	I_S0
I once had a very hard calculus problem in my homework, I asked one of my friend, who is one of the best student in that class, to help me solve that problem.	I_S0
She thought for a long time and gave me an answer but she is uncertain if it's right or not.	I_S0
Then I contacted one of my dad's friend who is a qualified tutor in mathematics.	I_S0
He solved the problem with clear explaination in a matter of minutes.	I_S0
If I accept the answer given by my friend, I'll get my homework wrong.	E_S0
Not only tutors are trained in terms of academic, but also they're trained specifically in education.	S_M1
A tutor knows well how to educate others.	B_S0
While great students know "what" is the right answer of a particular question, but they might have limited or less knowledge on "how" is it been solved and "why" is this question been asked like that as a tutor does.	I_S0
As the example mentioned before, my father's friend gave me very specific explaination with that problem so I can understand it really well, and that's the thing my friend couldn't give me regardless of the right or wrong of her answer.	E_S0
A great student might be closer to you as one of your same-aged peers, when they're helping you in a class, you may feel more relaxing and free, but a tutor is far more experienced and mature than a young student.	B_C0
He or she is a student once as well, so he or she can give you more tips or even shortcuts on your studies.	I_C0
Furthermore, since they're full-grown adults, tutors will treat you more strictly than your friends.	I_C0
They can even provide you a study plan according to your study pace and progress.	I_C0
Thus, you'll be pushed harder and achieve a grade even higher than you expected.	E_C0
 
Nowaday, withn the development of the ecnomic and the transportation people could travel around the world and aiways go there by themselves.	S_I0
So for this opointment that traveling in own country is better than traveling to foreign countries I don not agree with it .	S_T0
Traveling to foreign could bring a lot of benefit to us just like let us make some foreign friends and know the traditonal culture of other countries.	S_T1
Firstly, traveling abroad could broaden our herizon and enrich our knowledge.	S_M1
This information is very important for our future.	B_S0
If we go to the foreign country, we will feel different things with our country.	I_S0
For example, the food we eat and the language we speak.	I_S0
It is very necessary to learn some language that from the country we visite.	I_S0
If we learn these we will have a better travel in here.	I_S0
People also could learn some idea from other country's traditional.	I_S0
Each countries all have the distict philosophi idea.	I_S0
This is the guideline of the development of this country.	I_S0
Learning  these could enrich our brain and broaden our view.	I_S0
Not only that it also good for our future because we know more than others and we can think some good idea in a very short time.	I_S0
We could get the first hand in future hunting job.	E_S0
Secondly, we could make a lot friends and cultivate the social ability of us.	S_M1
For example, last summer I go to the USA and I live in a locational family.	B_S0
When I first arrive here I feel very lonely, they help me a lot.	I_S0
They always play game with me and take me to the park.	I_S0
Furthermore they also take to the place they work and I meet a lot of people.	I_S0
I communicate with them and told them the change in China.	I_S0

Nowadays, an interesting topic has aroused a heated debate: whether the parents living in the past time or the current parents are more involved in the education of their children?	B_I0
Some people hold the view that the answer is the past parents because they have more spare time spent on their children's education.	E_I0
However, as far as I am concerned, it is current parents that care the education of their children more.	B_T0
My view cab be elaborated as follows.	E_T0
First of all, the heavy peer pressure forces current parents to focus on their children's education.	S_M1
As we all know, current society requires comprehensive abilities.	B_S0
Therefore, parents are required to assist the study of their children in many circumstances, such as finishing their homework and developing some special hobby because usually will these things helps children stand out among their peers.	I_S0
For instance, my parents used to spend five hours on my education eveyday in order to guarantee that I have finished all my homework in a high quality since they though only if in this way could I standed out among my peers, entered a brilliant college in the future and further got a good job.	E_S0
Furthermore, current parents receive more education so that they are inclined and willing to participate in their children's education.	S_M1
Compared the failure in the popularity of education many years ago, curent parents get enough education, which ensures them to realize the importance of education and how crucial it is for parents to interact with children in their education.	B_S0
Consequently, all the spare time of current parents is occupied in their children's education.	I_S0
For example, given that both of my cousin's parents are professors in the university, it was the methods in term of improving academic performance and getting good grades that affected my cousin's attitude toward study since his parents addressed the role of study on people.	E_S0
 
In the recent years, many parents use many ways to encourage thier children to study well.	S_I0
And the money reward is one of these ways.	B_T0
But I do not think it is a good idea.	E_T0
First reason is that using money to reward to high grade thier children get will make them a wrong thinking of value, which is that we can get money if we get good grade not just study well.	S_M1
As we know, the final grade is not an aspect to judge a person.	B_S0
And we are studying for knowledge not for grade or money.	I_S0
Thus parents should change to other menthod to encourage children for a further study.	I_S0
They can do some intersting or meaningful things, such as having a abroad travel, visiting the museum and companying with children to do what they want.	I_S0
Money is not so important, but interests and meaning is.	E_S0
Secondly, every school will set up many scholarship for outstanding student.	S_M1
However, if your children get good grade, others may also great or even more.	B_S0
So it is the time to cultivate children's competitive powers.	I_S0
If you want to be rewarded, you must be better than others.	I_S0
This is definitely a good method to encourage student to work hard and become better.	E_S0
Above all, that is why I think giving money to school-age children money for high grade is a good idea.	B_C1
It may let children get in wrong way and useless for further study.	E_C1
 
Here we face a phenomenon where some parents offer their children money for their high grade every time.	B_I0
In my opinion, giving them money for prizes for a high mark is not a good idea.	E_I0
Children don't need the money for a prize.	B_T0
However, I think they can get something which is good for their study or daily life for the high mark instead.	E_T0
In our modern society, many people seek money instead of anything else.	S_M1
But I don't think money is the most important thing in our life.	B_S0
It's what we need for living.	I_S0
We need to have the money to guarenteer our healthy life.	I_S0
But the money way more than that is not necessary.	I_S0
In the oppisite, seeking money too much can make a person bad.	E_S0
School-age children are the future of human.	S_M1
They are growing up rapidly, so they need right thoughts in their minds, or they may develop into money-seekers in the end.	B_S0
Earning money by proper work is fine, but school-age children have their task - to focus on their study.	I_S0
Earning money or acquiring money in any other ways is not what children under 18 should do.	I_S0
Children who don't lack food or anything dailylife requires should not get extra money.	E_S0
As far as I am concerned, parents should not only pay attention to children's grades of knowledge, but also their qualities.	B_C0
Offering them money for a high mark may make the kid get into the habit of caring about money only.	I_C0
They may study hard only for the money.	I_C0
And if the money is gone, they may stop studying and say" what's the point?	I_C0
I can't get any money on it! "	I_C0
I think we can use something else instead, for example, a pen or a notebook is just fine.	E_C0
 
In modern society, socialization is becoming increaingly essential.	S_I0
Admittedly, friendship is shorter than it used to be because people no longer spare their time in making deep relationships  with others.	B_T1
However, so far as I am cocerned, maintaining relationship with a small amount of people is necessary and more important than making many new friends for one's happiness.	I_T1
Only these kind of friends can give you good impact, immediate help and true honesty in your whole life.	E_T1
Obviously, your close friends contribute most to the formation of your personality than other so-called friends.	S_M1
Personality is critical for happiness.	B_S0
This is why ancient people in China migrated to be neighbour wuth people with great reputation.	I_S0
The impact of close friend is slow but powerful, because you do almost everthing together and unconscioiusly, youmay imitate his or her behaviors.	I_S0
Time passes away, and the deeds turns into habits.	I_S0
As the proverb in China says: when you are close to red you become red, while to black become black.	E_S0
Undoutedly, only close friends give you immediate help when you need it.	S_M1
The more you pay out, the greater you obtain.	B_S0
When you are in trouble, these simple aquaintance will not give you a hand no only because they do not trust you but whether the help is worthywhile.	I_S0
Assistance when one is in trouble is like the hot coco in winter.	I_S0
It is a true happThere is a judgement in thier heart which never deserves true belief.	E_S0
Last but not least, true friends can point out your flaws, although you may do not want them to do so.	B_C0
There is no need for those acquaintance to critisize on you at the risk of breaking the relationship with you.	I_C0
However, if you didn't know your disadvatages, you would never manage to know how to correct it, and thus, you may make mistakes or make wrong decisions in your life.	E_C0
 
Whether or not it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is a hearted debate.	B_T0
On the one hand, some people believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects.	I_T0
On the other hand, some consider that it is better to specialize in noe specific subject.	I_T0
As for me, I am in favor of former.	E_T0
First of all,  students can enlarge the  scope of knowledge form learn many academic subjects because students can broaden students' horizon.	S_M1
For example, I an a high school student.	B_S0
I learn a variety of different aspect subjectsform school such as English, history, Chiese, chemistry, and so on.	I_S0
I can learn a lot of konwledge and enrich oneself.	I_S0
Thus, I think that it is so much the better to have broad konwledge of many academic subjects.	E_S0
Secondly,  students can reieve pressure from other subjects because major subjects have heavy studyload.	S_M1
For instance, my friend is a key high school student.	B_S0
The task of the main class id busy and has no homework every day.	I_S0
She will choose to take other complexlessons to relieve stress.	I_S0
As she can feel happy from other subjects.	E_S0
Therefore, it is all the better that students have broad of k	O
 
I think offer school-age children for each high grad they get in school is a good idea.	S_T0
Awarding by money is a good way to help children have cognition of money.	S_M1
Eveyrone in evry age can not leave without money,the ealier the children touch the money, the ealier they konw it is difficult for them to gain money by hard working,they will know how difficult their parents earn money, they may learn to cherish their parents sweat.	B_S0
To illustrsate this, I will give an example, my neighbour Mark,he works hard and he never use money on abundunt money on toys or computer games.	I_S0
However he is not thought as many people thought, he has lots of pocket money,because of his hard working.	I_S0
Once he talked with me, he came about that after every hard working he gained good mark and his mother may award him a lot of money,but he never use it on useless things.	I_S0
He points out that in order to finish his homework perfect, he stay up late and continue writing until 2 o'clock at midnight, it is likely that every money he pays back by himself.	I_S0
So I was inspired by what he talked, then I think it is better for children gain money by their high grade.	E_S0
Also, It is a indirect way to teach children how to arrange the money, each paid must be worthable.	S_M1
If children spend this deal of money on computer games, they may not have more money to taste what they want.	B_S1
In other words it can let children know how to distribute their pocket money in a correct way	E_S1
That is why i said	S_S2
 
Since the dawn of the humanity, young people habe been considered as the precious source of the society.	B_I0
In some societies, leaders do not let youngsters to participate in social events and have a share in taking vital decisions which have some effects on the future of the society.	E_I0
However, it is the opposite in some other communities.	S_T1
Although some people believe that today young adults have no influence on the important decisions, i have a different view.	S_T0
As far as i am concerned, i have a penchant for the standpoint that the young have and influential role in the decisions which related to the society's future.	S_T1
There are manifold reasons for holding that opinion, three of which are of paramount importance, which are elaborated upon hereunder.	S_S2
To begin with, the most striking reason why i support this view is the fact that young adults are now more involved in social issues than the past.	S_M0
By the advent of electronic devices and evolvement in technology, the young are more in touch which each other and as it is said the world changed to "a global village"which everybody knows about others.	B_S1
In this regard, the contribution of social media such as Facebook, Wechat to name but a few, should not be neglected on account of the fact that the society's issues are spread via these media as soon as possible.	E_S1
Another reason for accepting this opinion has to do with more educated young people these days.	S_M0
It stands to reason that today there are quite a few youngsters pursuing higher education who are capable of proposing practical suggestions and paving the way for taking crucial decisions.	B_S0
Moreover, by galloping rate in spreading numerous universities around the world, more people are now cognizant of what happens in the society.	I_S0
On the other hand, in the past people tended to focus on making money for living, and they did not care about what will happen to their society in that they did not consider themselves as a member of the society.	E_S0
Last but not least, nowadays young adults can be more effective in making a decision than the past.	S_M0
Today they can establigh a campaign against or for something that harms or benefits the society thanks to the vast access to the social media.	B_S0
For instance, in Iran, there is a campaign that wants citizens not to use their cars one day of the week.	I_S0
With this in mind, the air pollution of the city will sharply decrease.	I_S0
It is worth mentioning that nowadays young people are braver to express their ideas and thoughs than the past, and they can reach their goals using demonstration or other ways.	E_S0
All in all, with all this taken into account, the young have had many effects' on the society through the history.	B_C0
I vehemently subscribe to the view that young people now are more influential on the society's future than the past on the grounds that they have more access to the news, more educated, and have more effectove ways than before.	I_C0
The young are always the precious treasures of a society which should be utilized in order to reach success.	E_C0
 
OVER YEARS , INCREASING NUMBERS OF PARENTS QUESTION ABOUT WEATHER THEM SHOULD LET THIR CHILDREN MAKE MISTAKES RATHER THAN SOLVE THE MISTAKES .	B_T0
AS WE ALL KNOW PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES, AND IT IS APPORPRIATE FOR CHILDREN MAKE MISTAKES.	E_T0
ALSO I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT LET CHILDREN LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES.	S_T1
TO BEGIN WITH, LEARN FORM YOUR MISTAKE IS A KIND OF ABILITY TO LET THEMSELF BECOME BETTER.	S_M0
I SUPPORT THAT IT IS EASILY FOR ONE LEARN SOME GOOD HABBITY SENCE HE OR SHE WAS YOUNG, AND WHRN ONE LEARNS THIS KIND OF SKILL, SHE OR HE WILL NOT MAKE A SAME MISTAKE TEICE.	B_S0
NO MATTER IS DURING THE WORK OR STUDY.	I_S0
FOR INSTANCE, IF ONE CAN ALWAYS LEARN FORM MISTAKES THEN THIS MAN WILL BECOME SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE HE OR SHE GET THE LESSIONS FROM IT, AND NEXT TIME THIS MAN WILL AVOIED THIS PEOBLEM.	E_S0
NEXT, LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKE IS ALSO THE WAY YOU GET NEW INFORMATION.	S_M0
FOR EXAMPLE, A CHILD ONCE BREAK A CUP AND HER OR HIS PARENTS LET THIS CHILD LEARN FORM IT.	B_S1
BUCAUSE OF HIS OR HER UNCOUNCIOULESS AND NEXT TIME THIS CHILD WILL NOT DOES THIS AGAIN AND NOT NOLY TAKES THE CAP , BUT ALSO TREAT EVERY THING CAREFILLY.	E_S1
LASTLY, WHEN EVERY PARENTS GETTING OLDER , THERE WILL BE NO ONE POINT OUT THEIR CHILDREN'S MISTAKE, AND THIS CHILDREN HAVE TO LIVE ALONE.	S_M0
IF ONE NEVER LEARN FORM THEIR MISTAKES AND SHE OR HE ALSO DO NOT KNOW HOW TO LEARN FROM IT .	B_S1
ONE'S LIFE WILL BECOME REALLY COMPLICATE FOR HIMSELF OR HERSELF.	E_S1
IN CONCLUTION , FROM MY PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW, I HOLD POINT THAT PARENTS SHOULD LET THEIR CHILDREN LEARN FROM THEIR MISTAKES.	B_C1
BECAUSE LEARN FROM ONE'S MISTAKES IS A KIND OF LIFE SKILL AND THAT HELPS YOU DEVELOPPING YOU KNOLEDGE OF THE LIFE AND ALSO THE INDEPENDENCE.	E_C1
 
While parents begin to concentrate more on their kids' education nowadays, they come up with more ideas to inspire their kids to study better.	B_I0
One of their ways is to reward their kids with money while their kids do well in the school.	E_I0
This kind of act actually have positive influence on the grades of their kids, but sometimes it brings out negative affect in more aspects if it's not executed in a right way.	S_T1
Researches over these years have revealed that children at a low age are more easily motivated by the cheering from others.	S_M1
For most children, parents are also the closest people from who they want praise and rewards.	B_S0
After they receive the kindness from their parents they also gain stronger power in studying.	I_S0
As a tool which children can decide the usage on their own, money as well can let the children raise a view of consuming from their young age.	I_S0
Especially under the guidance of their parents, it can help them manage their economy and let them realize the rareness of different things.	I_S0
Thus offering money is not a bad idea while everything is in good control of the children's parents.	E_S0
However, giving their kids money without a certain rule might lead to unexpected results.	S_M1
For instance, one child might try to get the money without a proper way, such as cheating in the exams, plagiarism and etc.	B_S0
If parents don't pay enough attention to their children's acts, it will not work as their parents expected and fall into a bad result.	I_S0
Parents should keep in mind that offering money is just a method to inspire their kids to study better, the actual participation of parents in education cannot be replaced by this simple method, which means their presence is also essential.	E_S0
To offer the school-age children money cannot be said wrong, but parent theirselves should care enough about their children.	B_C1
The mind control is always important.	E_C1
 
With the education systems get more and more advanced, wether allow the kids learn from their mistakes or not become a controversal topic recently.	S_I0
Lots of professors argue this idea so that they want to assist lots of parents to have a efficient way to teach their kids.	S_T1
In my opinions, i think that this methods may become more and more popular in the future and i support it very much.	S_T0
Firstly, this method can make the students remember the mistakes deeply so that they can avoid making them again in the future.	S_M1
We all know that it is impossible for students to make some of offensive actions.	B_S0
If we tolerate them first time and then teach them wether it is benefitial or not, they may have a impress and memorize what they did.	I_S0
After the events, they will remember those mistakes and know that repeat those mistakes may get punish.	I_S0
As a result, When they suck into this situations again in the future in future, they may think twice.	E_S0
In addition, according the research,every children have destroy phychology at birth.	S_M1
All the kids may graint the happiness after they mess up alduts plans.	B_S0
If the parents can stand it once and teach them those actions are not friendly.	I_S0
They may no longer make it again because thet have already taste the sense of destroy achievement.	I_S0
For examples, I prefer to mess the house after my parents cleaning then i was a child.	I_S0
I really satisfy to see that they clean the floor or wash the glass walls.	I_S0
And once after i did mess, my parents actually not punish me in time, thet just watch me to make process and after i feel fully achievement.	I_S0
They told me to fix the house by myself and at that time, i get the feeling of fatigue.	I_S0
From that events, I promise i will not did such fool things any more.	E_S0
Some people argues that we can't allow the kids to make mistakes, we have to kill all their bad ideas immediately.	B_C0
However, we all know that it is not impossible actually.	I_C0
In fact, the things parents have do is that teach the kids to become a good person in the future and gurantee their kids grow up successfully.	I_C0
To make kids get more muture, it is necessary to make them learn from their mistakes and this skill also benefits themselves when they grow up.	E_C0
 
Nowadays, an interesting topic has aroused a heated debate: whether leadership comes naturally or not?	B_I0
Some people hold the view that one cannot learn to be a leader.	E_I0
However, as far as I am concerned, leadership can be learned by many ways.	B_T0
My view can be elaborated as follows.	E_T0
First of all, one can learn how to be a leader by reading the photography of some famous leaders.	S_M1
As we all know, photography contains a person's main actions and thinkings during his life.	B_S0
In this way, by reading such stories, it is for granted that people are inclined to master the leader's logical system, such as how they think about questions.	I_S0
Therefore, when they encounter some troubles in the future, the first thing occurs in their mind is how to anlysis the trouble in the perspective of leader.	I_S0
For example, as we all know, Jack Ma's favorite book is the photography of Bill Gauce.	I_S0
After grasping the method how to become a brilliant leader in the domain of computer and how to bulit a successful empire by reading the book, Jack Ma become a great leader and creat one of the biggest company selling goods online in the world.	E_S0
Furthermore, people can study to become a leader by mimicing the fabulous leaders' activities.	S_M1
There is no doubt that some activites, especially things about words, such as how to deliver a vivid speech and how to communicate with others can be grasped by mimicing others' motions.	B_S0
So usually it is a precise chance to become a leader by carefully observing the activies of qualified leader.	I_S0
After this proccess, other people will definitely feel a special sense which belongs to a former leader and inevitably consider whose who mimic the former leader as their new leader.	I_S0
For instance, our former president Obama has watched all the speechs presented by Lincolin.	I_S0
Therefore, when he also had a speech, Americans thought he was extremely like one of their favorite president	E_S0
 
Currently, with the development of society, people attach more and more attention to education.	S_I0
And there is a heated discussion that should teachers paid as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders.	B_T1
Opinion divided and personally speaking, I think it is very necessary to equal the salaries of teachers and other careers above.	I_T1
My point is well elaborated as follows.	E_T1
To begin with, only when teachers' salary is indistinguished from the salary of other decent careers can teathers try their best to cultivate students, which is the future of our country.	S_M2
To illustrate, with the stimulation of higher paid, teachers find it easier to devote their whole heart to students instead of worrying about the basic material lifes.	B_S0
In this way, chances are that students could learn better.	I_S0
On the contrary, if teachers could even not figure out their problem of living, how could they concerntrate carefully on teaching.	I_S0
For example, my teachers, who used to take 1000 yuan every month, had to take a pay-time jobs as a tuitor in other school to support his large family.	I_S0
Therefore, every time I wanted to ask some question about study, he was always busy in works.	I_S0
However, since teachers salary is improved to 5000yuan this year, he doesn't have to take double jobs and he can spend more time dealing with student's problem respectly.	I_S0
Had not the salary of teachers have improved, how could us students have such high quality education.	E_S0
In addition, it is the high salary that can enforce more high-education graduations to teach.	S_C2
To elaborate, given that contemperate graduations pay more attention to the material life, it salary becomes the force factor to attract high quailty educator.	B_S0
With more and more high-degree teachers, the students can learn better.	I_S0
However, without that attraction,most of people might choice other high-paid carrers, such as doctors and so on.	E_S0
For example, my brother, even thou	O
 
Nowadays,as the techonology is developing fast,there is more stress on young people.	B_I0
Their are so busy with their work ,family even the relationship between friends.	E_I0
So it's a neccesserity that young people should have the skill to make plan and organize their own business well.	S_T0
At first, make an appropriate plan is the most important one in my opinion.	S_M1
For it can help us do our work efficiently.	B_S0
For myself, every time when I meet too many assignments,I'd like to make a list which contian everything I need to do .	I_S0
And according to that ,I can follow the list and do all the work regularly.	I_S0
So I would not be too exhausted to consider about what should I do first or what should I do after that.	E_S0
secondly,organizing well can make us do everything efficiently.	S_M1
Imaging that, there are a lot of work for we to do ,and we should finish them on time.	B_S0
So at this time, if we put them all together in order, then we will do them all step by step.	I_S0
While,we can do the things in time without thinking twice.	E_S0
Although, the atomosphere around us is always full of noise,we should still be calm down and arrange everything regularly in advance.	B_C0
Personally, when I am facing these difficulties,I would like to try my best to make my schedule perfect .	I_C0
Becaus I clearly know that,the ability to plan and organize is a helpful friend for me to confront all trial things.	E_C0
 
I think this is a good idea that some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.	B_I0
Firstly,the power to study hard is very important to school-age children.	I_I0
Parents made their children know that if they get high mark at school they can earn some money to buy something they want.	I_I0
This is another way for school-age children to get pocket money.	I_I0
Besides doing house work,study hard at school maybe relaxer for school-age children.	I_I0
Children always want to compare with others that someone have a new video game or beautiful doll they don't have.	I_I0
They usually ask their for help.	I_I0
But if school-age children have more pocket money from the high grade they get in school,they can buy what they want for theirselves.	I_I0
Competition between clothes or toys gradually transports into the competition for the marks they get in school.	E_I0
This is a good strategy to increase children's desires to get good grades.	S_T1
Secondly,offer school-age children money in this way can also tell them the difficulties to earn money.	S_M2
Studying hard at school is not easier than doing a good job in a company.	B_S0
During the time children to get high marks,they push themselves to study in a deep way.	I_S0
They have no time to play computer games or be lazy for their school work.	I_S0
They must spend more time on studies in ordre to get higher marks.	I_S0
So they spend more time than others to get good results.	I_S0
Parents can tell them only if you spend more effort than others in studies can you get higher marks .	I_S0
So does it during the work they have in the future.	E_S0
Thirdly,offering children money for each high grade they get in school can help them establish their attitude toward studies and work.	B_C1
If you want to earn more than others,you have to spend more time and efforts on your work and study.	E_C1
It is good for thier children to have a great competitiveness in thier work in the futu	O
 
Nowdays,many parents offer money to their children for high grades,which makes the study enrionment becoming attempting.	S_I0
I don't think it's a good idea to take this method and I would illustrate some reasons to evidence it's misleading viewpoint.	S_T0
As far as I'm concerned,originally,it's a thing for children to study by their own which benifits them in the whole life,nobody can push the process,however parents show money makes it more relying,what if a student learning without rewards?	S_M1
Furthermore,to be frank,no one can deny the fact that there are nothing to substaince acknowledge in mind including money,we can absolutly regard education as a class which fees could't and can't buy.	B_S1
Lastly, before involving in society,we should make sure that students' goal is making our country better rather than just earning money for living,on no account should we ignore the value of it and under no circumstanse shall we forget the significance of it.	E_S1
I never gain any rewards in high marks from parents,it's a normal and a routin to take my whole effort on studying,making a tremandously paper.	S_M1
In any rates,money have no uses maintaining skills,in which absorbing your head.	S_S2
 
I don't agree to watching a movie or reading a book to get a relax are a better way than doing physical exercise.	B_T0
First,as we know,the modern people's stree is mentally stress,instead of physical stress.	E_T0
So,there are is a huge group of person who sitting on a work chair,seeing computer,or writing documents in all days , the tired is their brain,eyes,instead of their body.	B_T1
so,doing a physical exercise can let them feel get energel,and let them brain free.	E_T1
They can think anything just runing,riding,or swimming.	B_S1
And in the otherhand,the suitable exercise can rise human's body,a man need to exercise if he sitting all days.	E_S1
But watching a movie or reading a book still need ours to use brain ,eyes,to thinking,watching,.	S_M2
We just feel a relax in a short time,and when we out the cineme,or put down the book ,we still tired,both our body and mental.	B_S0
And for most people,they will watching movie or reading book in a sofa,even in bed,this way could make them body more lazy,and more tired.	I_S0
I think no one could have a high quilty life without regulally sporting.	E_S0
The relaxed way on the chair--- the action that can not let your body move---is not become a usually relaxed way of yours---It's my opinion.	B_C0
You can watching a movie or reading a book once a week,but you should doing physical exercise every day,and this is better way to releave your stress,you will feel better.	I_C0
Believe me.	I_C0
Doing physical exercise could make your body tired,and you will eatting more food, having a better sleeping ,and it will helps you to join in a new days works, and then the ability of understress of yours will be more stronger,and you will join in a good cycle---more ability,more healthy.	E_C0
 
As for me, I agree with the agreement.	B_T0
In our comtemporary society, larger quantities of people are likely to help someone in need, mainly for the following three reasons.	E_T0
To begin with, it is more convenient to help others.	S_M0
With technology developing rapidly, people are able to communicate with  others in a more comfortable way, and thus a great number of ways to assist others are created.	B_S0
For instance, there is an Internet program aimed at collecting money for the poors.	I_S0
People can only use moblie phones to complete the charity process.	I_S0
The Internet provides us with more convenient approaches to help others.	E_S0
Then, people today who are living a better life than in the past have a better financial condition to enable them to help the struggling strangers.	S_M0
As we know, nearly all countries in the world enjoy an excellent increase in GDP, which offers citizens more money to spend on spare issues.	B_S1
People today are more capable to give a hand to strangers, like giving money to the patients who are in short of money.	E_S1
Finally, we make more communication with others at present.	S_M0
With more people we talk with and more patterns of life we see, we will have a better understanding of struggling of other people.	B_S0
And the sense of understanding is sure to motivate us to assist them.	I_S0
Take two different positions for example.	I_S0
A salesman will know a taxis driver's hard if they have some interactions.	I_S0
And today the interactions are easier to realize.	E_S0
To sum up, people today are certainly more likely to help stranges in need of assistance, in whatever aspects.	B_C1
Although there are some indifferent events happening in our life, I believe our world will become warmer and more harmony for the reason that more and more people are willing to help strangers.	E_C1
 
With the development of siciety, more and more people begin to be concerned about the education of their children.	S_T0
A variety of educational methods, including offering children money for each high grade they get, have been invented to benefit children's physical and mental health and development.	S_T1
From my perspective, it is a beneficial and practical idea to award children money when they obtain a good grade.	S_T0
Firstly, awarding children money when they get good grades can make them more motivated to study.	S_M0
I'll use my own experience to illustrate it.	B_S0
When I was studying in elementary school, I usually had piles of assignments and endless exams, which sometimes made me too stressful and frustrated to study and ended up wasting time playing computer games.	I_S0
However, when my father started to offer me money when I got good grades, I was motivated to study hard to get the award to buy snacks and books that I longed for.	I_S0
Soon my grades were improved obviously as a consequence.	E_S0
Furthermore, offering children money provides a chance to train their skills of managing money reasonably.	S_M0
In this money-oriented world, it is vital to gain the awareness of controling one's own economical condition and knowledge about how to manage the possession.	B_S1
If parents can teach their children about how to make a clear plan on spending money properly at the same time when they offer them money, their children will be less possible to get confused and anxious about the management of their wealth when they become independent and start to earn money on their own.	E_S1
Last but not the least, it is also an excellent way to increase parents' involvement in their children's education and growth.	S_M0
By offering children money, parents are able to know about their children's strengths and weaknesses in study.	B_S0
Then they may search methods, such as hiring a tutor, to help them to solve children's problems and difficulties in study.	I_S0
Besides, it is easy to know from the flunctuation of the children's grades that they may meet some disturbances in their daily life.	I_S0
It offers the parents a great opportunity to communicate with their children and make their relationship closer.	E_S0
In a word, I will recommand parents to offer their children money for their good grades.	B_C1
In my opinion, it not only benefits children's growth but also improves parents' relationships with their children.	E_C1
 
Nowedays, every country pays more attention on the technology.	B_I0
Because of the technology, there are many products are invented.	E_I0
It also has some influence on development of children.	B_T0
I think children can get some benefits from it.	E_T0
First, children can extend their fierd of knowledge, becasue technology bring many tools that can help us maintain information.	S_M1
For example, in the past time, children did not have opportunity to learn about the other things, becasue they did not have this conditons.	B_S0
But now, children can through televison, Internet or eletric books to learn about the world.	I_S0
When they obtain these informations, the will have some knowledge basis.	I_S0
Thus they can depend on their knowledge to create more things that people can have benefits from.	I_S0
If they do not have this basis, their mind will be narrow, becasue they do not know what will have important influence on human.	E_S0
Second, as the development of technology, there are many products about exercising mind or imspiring children's potention,or ect have invented.	S_M1
Parents can use this tools to let children grow up healithily.	B_S0
Children's potentional can be used as possible as they can.	I_S0
And this potention is unpredicted, so children can have more creative ideas for it.	I_S0
In the past, the living conditons, educating conditions or something like it are very poor.	I_S0
Parents do not know how to educate children with correct perspectives, they even do not know what is potential or how to inspure it.	I_S0
Therefore, many children's intelligence will be wasted.	E_S0
Finally, because of the technology, many communicating tools or more convient vehicles are invented.	B_C0
People can have a travel going to different place or have more chances to communicate with different people.	I_C0
In this process, people will become more international.	I_C0
They will have plentiful experience and they can undergo different culture.	I_C0
When they accumulate this experience, they have their opinons for many things.	I_C0
When they decide their ideas, they will work hard on this direction.	E_C0
When they explore their world, there are many thing will h	O
 
Sometimes some parents just think that it is unnecessary to let their young childrn learn how to manage money.	S_I0
Nevertheless I cannot disagree with this statement more.	S_T0
As for as I'm concern, it is crucial for children to learn how to manage their money, though maybe only small amount of, in order to be a finacially responsible adult.	S_T1
First, learning to manage money makes a child know how precious the money is.	S_M0
Therefore, they won't exploit their money on things of no use.	B_S0
Then one day, my mother gives me 100 yuan and told me that this was all the money available in this month.	I_S0
I reluctantly managed my money and felt that it was really hard to getenough money.	I_S0
Therefore I never waste money any longer as I grow up.	E_S0
Second, learnng to manage money teaches children how to increase their fortune.	S_M0
As I have said in the last statement, money is precious and it is hard to increase our budget and put our money into things that can increase our fortune - for instance, a child may use part of his pocket money to buy some cards and sell the cards to his friends to gain some extra money.	B_S1
Children who are familiar with how to increase their fortune by managind their money are more likely to gain finacial success in the future.	E_S1
Third, learning how to manage money can also help children to manage other aspects of their daily life.	S_M0
As a child is used to managing other aspects in life, such as time.	B_S0
People who do good time management usually have a balanced life.	I_S0
They work and study happily and enjoy their life.	E_S0
To conclude, I stron	S_S2
 
Nowadays, the modern technique make the life of people better, so we have more spare time.	B_I0
And about how to deal with this leisure, most people want to relax.	E_I0
But on the way of relax, we always have different thoughts.	S_T1
Some one think watching a movie or reading a book can mold character, can enhance the level of our culture, it is the best way to relax.	S_M0
But in the other hand, other people think it is better to relax by doing physical exercise, it benefits our body.	B_S0
Facing these two different choices, many people will be confuse and don't know how to choose.	I_S0
Therefore, in my opinion, I prefer to do some exercise.	E_S0
First of all, people often say that the body of revolution, a capital, life, health is wealth.	S_M0
Only the healthy body can give us enough energy to study and work well.	B_S0
So, we have to do more exercise and sports to get a great body.	I_S0
Doing sports lilke running, swimming, playing soccer will make your body respond favorably.	I_S0
However, reading or wqatching movies can only make you put on weight, lose wonderful shape and healthy body.	E_S0
Secondly, many people have found that physical exercise is a productive way to deal with stress.	S_M0
We all know that we can sleep better if we exercise everyday.	B_S1
And when you combine healthier eating with exercise your body will respond fevorably and the stress levels will start to decrease.	E_S1
Finally, go out to do exercise can also be a social activity.	S_M0
For example, if you like to do some teamwork sports, you can make many new friends who have same interests, and you can enhance your relationship with your old friends by doing this too.	S_S2
So I think it is better to relax by doing physical exercise.	B_C1
it is very well for our body and mind.	E_C1
 
I consider that it is a good idea.	B_T1
Because I think school-age children have great needs in having ecouragement from their parents.	E_T1
If they don't,they may suffer in great desprssion.	B_S0
I've seen a news displayed on television said that a 12-year-old girl commited suicide because of the despression, and the depression was caused from her parents' ignorence.	I_S0
This is a warning to those parents who are ignoring their children.	I_S0
let parents give thier children some money to reward their achievements is the easiest way to show that they do care about what they have done.	I_S0
But the amount of the money need to be controlled.	I_S0
Parents are not supposed to give children too much money.	I_S0
The money just a sign of reward, if they are too much, it may turn a reward into a disaster.	I_S0
It was reported that a boy,which had a lot of money given by his parents ,were robbed by a group of homeless men.	I_S0
So,parents need to consider how much money they shall give to their children .	E_S0
 
With the generation of the internet, people are more willing to spent their free time on smartphone and laptop to obtain more infromation from facebook and other social communication application.	B_S0
As a consequence, the report of some famous star cannot avoaid to plunge into their eyesight.	I_S0
More and more informations about super stars are now available to be searched on goole.	I_S0
It means famous entertainers and athletes have less privacy than before.	I_S0
But in my oppinon, I consider they cannot have more privacy than have now.	E_S0
To begin with, I consider that stars is the guideline of their fans.	S_M2
Therefore, they should be exposed into the public view in order to make sure that they does no thing wrong.	B_S1
On the opposite, if the stars have more privacy, they may out of supervise and some of they may have some bad behavior which can make a bad influence on the sociey.	E_S1
For instance, some stars	O
 
Studens usually are affected by other people.	B_I0
Some people think they will easily effect by their teachers.	I_I0
However, i have different ideas.	I_I0
I think friends have uch more effect.	I_I0
First, usually students spend more time with their friends tather than teachers.	I_I0
Students just can see teacher during the calsses or sometime in breaktime, but for must, students playing games and studying  together, On these periods, their friends can affect them lots.	I_I0
Take myself as an example, when i studied in school, I had a best frined.	I_I0
We live in same building and studied in same school, so usually we speneded all the day toghter.	I_I0
He pretty liked eating apples almost every lunch, when i had lunch with him he sended a apple to me, so untill now, i still have a hobby to eat apple.	I_I0
From other aspect, when we had conflict with others, usually i wanted to fight with others, but he was different, he wanted to nigotiate with others.	I_I0
By the time passing, I changed my bad temperture.	I_I0
However i didn't remenber who were my teachers in kindgarden.	E_I0
Hence  i deem friends have much more effect than teachers.	S_T1
Second, friendship means a close relationship, but teachers some time are very serious, so students more willing to trust their friends.	S_M2
Basical on the trust, friends will have more effect than teachers.	B_S1
take myself as example, i perfer to trust my friends so they have more effect on me.	E_S1
In conclution ,friends have more effect thanteachers.	S_C2
 
Recently，there has an new question about family education ，with the development of economy，many peoples life are getting more and more better，to make their children get a high grade in school，some parents offer their chidren money，I dont think its a good idea.	S_T1
First but not list,it  will give their chidren a bad impact that what they do is only for money.	S_M1
There has a clear public idea that study is not only for make money.	B_S1
We will learning for how to stay with other people,how to make friends,how to learn something we dont kown before,and the most important——learning skill and who am i.All this are we can not get only from giving money.	E_S1
second,it may lead a worse impact that someone who has not get a good grade but want to get money may tells a joke to their parents.	S_M1
on the one hand,she or he will get more nervous about a bad mark and get more bad,on the other hand ,it may starting their habit to tell jokes.	B_S1
above two sections are not well to chidrens life.	E_S1
so, i dont think offer chidrens money for each high grade they get in school is a good idea.	S_C2
 
From my perspectivem, watching a movie or reading a book is definetely a effective way of unwinding oneself, i concead that going for a film is probably the most popular way that all people have once used.	B_I0
However, we can never deny that doing physical erercise such as long diatance running or swimming is also a widely recommened and accepted methology, which has already been proved to be helpful in relieving pressure.	E_I0
First and foremost, there are two critical reasons why reading books or watching movies can contributes to relaxing oneself.	S_M1
one is that books and movies is a essential source that we build up our konwledge and get to know what difficulties and challenges other people have entercountered.	B_S0
Thus strengthing our resistance mentally.	I_S0
By studying some others' cases, people conclude their sollutions and results, people will realize their puzzles more clerely and immediately, and subsequently know the possible consequence, which finally ease their upsetting feelings.	E_S0
Suffice it to say, doing physical exercise would reduce sense of unease in multiple ways.	S_M1
Not only in the way of building up pricious spirits like dilligence or cultivating good virtues, but also offering a chance of meeting new friends.	B_S1
Needless to say, challenging situations won't push too hard on you if you just have a loyal friend who can listen to your complaints, shouldering your pressure and reaching out a helping hand when in need.	E_S1
so, physical exercise is a combination of building up personalities and making friends.	S_C2
 
Recently,how to lead a team become a problem.	B_I0
Some people complained it is difficult to be a leader, as it require ones' gift.	E_I0
But I think leading a team is possible to leading the team if ones would study the ability which is vital to be the captain in the group.	S_T1
First and foremost, the leadship need ones to be friendly.	S_M2
This could be reqiured after long time staying with member.	B_S0
During this time, the people could be tolerance in the aspect in deal with conflict before people, then they could get a part of leadership.	I_S0
One of my friends, who had not be a lead before, when our teacher reqiured some in class to be a group, as study for a long time, he could be friendly to us so he become the leader in our group.	E_S0
Then, the leader could lead the team be impressive which also could be abtained during exercise in after days' study.	S_C2
Making members impressive is a ability that ones would encourage the team confidentely this could be reqired if ones is confident enough.	S_S2
 
With the social conditions changing remarkably nowadays, more and more people, especially teenage and youth, argue for freedom.	B_I0
Therefore, there arises an interesting debate on whether young people have to follow too many rules nowadays.	I_I0
Some hold the view that the are some rules that is out of date, so these rules are not suitable to be followed any longer.	E_I0
However, I think the rules that young people are expected to follow are not strict.	S_T1
First, these rules are conducive to prevent young people from commiting crimes and then upholding the stability of society, since young people tend to get to abrupt sometimes.	S_M1
The features of young people often contain braveness.	B_S0
On the otehr hand, this also means that young people can easily become rash and angry.	I_S0
Thus, they tend to fight or even do something illegitimate, such as roberry.	I_S0
Rules can demonstrate to the young people about what is requested, and what is forbidden.	I_S0
And less rate of rubbery will lead to society stability.	I_S0
For example, there were a village in China, where young people commit crimes frequently.	I_S0
However, after the local government passed strict laws to prohibit these crimes, crimes such as  roberry became significantly lessened because young people realized the severeness of doing such things.	I_S0
So strict rules do keep young people from crimes.	E_S0
What is more, these rules facilitate the growing of young people.	S_M1
Young people are always full of imagination and spirit of venture.	B_S0
But this also means they would like to think of something unrealistic.	I_S0
This is the symptom of not being mature.	I_S0
Rules can help them think twice before making a certain decisions, in which process young people learn to grow up.	I_S0
Without rules, such as that people under the age of 18 are not allowed to smoke and drink alchol, they might make decisions just for temporary joy, which in turn lead to infinite regret.	E_S0
Considering all-above explanation, it nessec	S_S2
 
well, i think parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.	S_T1
because only in this way that students can really recognize what is right from wrong, and it's benefit for children.	S_T0
in the first place, technolgical advances have created new ways to take care of mundane tasks quickly and easily.	S_M1
For example, the majority of Americans now have their own personal computers.	B_S0
This is an amazing advance: with computers, we can complete tasks., from banking to ordering groceries, that would have taken hours even a few decades ago.	I_S0
word processing is common, making th spread of information mch easier to achieve, and education is available to all for free through online courses and informaion ha would have been all but unattainable for many up until th end of the twentieth century.	I_S0
The sheer amount of access that we have to services and knowledge through these machines has made ilfe extraordinarily easier.	E_S0
secondly, our standard of life has changed through advances in engineering, architecture, travel, and even textiles.	S_M1
Looking at a film like The lion of winter, while by no means historically perfect, does show how even everyday things were more difficult almost a thousand years ago.	B_S1
set in the 1100s, the film shows king henry having to break ice from his water bowl to get water to wash his face-- something that hot and cold running taps have long since saved us from.	E_S1
in conclusion, life today is definitely easier than life in the past.	B_C0
though it is easy to read stories of nobles and kings of history and romanticize them, their lives were almost certainly more uncomfortable than our lives are.	I_C0
nevertheless, there are many places in the world where laptops, modern conveniences, and vaccines are rarely found; i hope that current generations will work together to make life easier for everyone, now that it is possible to do so.	E_C0
 
In my opinion, it is not a good idea for parents to give money to their school-age children for each high grade they get in exams.	B_T0
And my reasons are as follows.	E_T0
First of all, nobody can deny that most  school-age children are not aware of money, and they may not have a wise way to spend the money.	S_M1
Condersing their youth, like most kids' interest, they might spend it on toys, video games, snake foods or even alcholo and cigarettes and then leading to obesity and nearsightness, or being addicted to games, which could have bad infulence on their studies and health.	B_S1
Form this viewpoint, the money parents give maght be a dangerous gift to award their children for their high grades.	E_S1
Secondly, it is acknowledged that education is essential for everyone, and studying and learning only benefit you yourself in your life.	S_M1
If children get used to take money from parents because of high grades, they would gradually become those who study only for money instead of knowledge and they can easily forget to be educated for themslves in the long term.	B_S1
Once there is no reward they want, chlidren would refuse to learn and study, and this is a disater in such a society that everyone is supposed to a life-long learner.	E_S1
Last but not least	S_S2
 
With the development of the techonology, people now have a variety of ways to relax,such as watching movies, reading books or even doing exercises.	B_T1
Some people contend that it is more advisable for them to doing exercises because they can enjoy the sports  which can help them relax.	E_T1
However, on the other hand, I think it is more wise for people to relax by watvhing movies or reading books.	B_T0
Because through watching or reading , people can get entertainments  which can help them relax, and they can also forget about the troubles so that they can have a better condition to work	E_T0
To begin with, people can reading books or watching movies for entertainments.	S_M0
There are now many TV programs or various types of books for people to entertain.	B_S0
According to researches, laughing is the best way for people to relax.	I_S0
And through watching funny books or movies, poeple can express their upset feelings  through laughing.	I_S0
Then, they would feel much better and they would feel relaxed after they watching funny movies and books.	I_S0
As a result, people should relax through watching moies and books which can make them laugh and make them happier.	E_S0
Additionally, reading books or watching movies can make people forget about the troubles which can help them relax their minds.	S_M0
Through reading or watching attractive stories, people can get themselves completely in to those romantic or magical stories.	B_S0
They would forget all of their troubles and focus on the book or movie so that they can refresh their minds and heavy hearts.	I_S0
Then they would have a better condition and attitude toward their future work and study.	I_S0
As a result, indivisuals would better choose to watch movies or read books rather than exercise.	E_S0
Although exercising is a paramount way of relxing, people can still feel tired after an exhausting day.	S_M0
Because many people would feel more tired after exrcising and they do not wanto move after wo.	B_S0
Contrast to reading books or movies, individuals would only have to sit on a couch, and enjoy their movies or books without any movement so that they can feel relaxed both mentally and phsically.	I_S0
As a result, people can get the most benefits through watchng movies or reading books instead of exercising.	E_S0
To sum up, though reading books or watching movies, people can get entertainment  which can make them feel much happier, and at the same time they can have a better conditions to work and study.	B_C0
Although exercises can be a good way to relax, sometimes it just makes people more tierd and exhausted after having exercises.	I_C0
As a result, it is a more advisable choice for people to choose watching movies or reading books  to relax.	E_C0
 
Have you ever seen the polychrome pack of the candies in the advertising?	B_I0
Have you ever seen some vigorous boys or girls speaking for some new products?	I_I0
As a common teenager, I am often absorbed by some fascinating advertising and buy the same products are not as great as the advertising, so from my perspective, most products in advertisement is better than they really are.	E_I0
On the one hand, the great advertisement of the merchant enhance the sale.	S_M1
To be more convincible, the merchant use the alluring images of the product to attracts customs, and these images actually is made of some photoshops.	B_S0
As a result, customs are attracted by these images and then to buy it.	I_S0
For instance, like the Oreo, a chocolate biscuit with a milk filling, is a common filling biscuit, however, according to the advertising, a man mix with hot milk in the chocolate biscuit, its fascinating.	I_S0
So obviously, the increasing number of people will buy the Oreo after watching the advertisement, then the sale of the Oreo is enhance.	E_S0
On the other hand, the real product that is not as good as the one in advertising enhance the profit.	S_M1
To be more sepcific, the merchant can decrease the costing then enhance the profit.	B_S0
For instance, in order to attracting more customs, the merchant enables the celebrity spokesperson to speak for their products, likes a Soothing Mist, they enables the star who has smoothing skins to attract more customs believe their product, then a big cost is coming.	I_S0
It is a good way to decrease the costing by decrease the quality of their product.	E_S0

Nowadays with the development of the society and the economy, more and more people can travel over the world.	S_T0
A lot of people prefer t travel in a group and led by a tour guide because they will not pay more attention on other things just like the way to the site and go where to have a lunch.	S_T1
Furthermore, the member in a group can help each other when someone meet some problem and this way is more cheap than travel by ourselves.	S_T0
Firstly, to travel in a groupby a tour guide we can think less things and just enjoy the time we travel.	S_M1
For example, if we have a guide we can achieve the place we want to go very quickly so it will help us save the time and we have more time to visit other sites.	B_S0
Not only that, we also will pay no attention on the the transportations because the mambers of the group all in a big bus and they also will gain a good driver.	I_S0
So the visiter will not be worry about how to find a taxi and what way is the shortest way to the site.	I_S0
Moreover is the food; the guide he is familiar with thuis place so he can lead to taste the delicious food in this place and they can lead you to know more deeper about the culture of this place; he can lead you to meet soem local residences.	I_S0
All of these enjoyable and convinience will give the members in this group have a great memeries so  the best way go travel is in a group and have a leader.	E_S0
Secondly, if one of the person in this group meet some problem, they other members can find this very quickly and help to solve this problem.	S_M1
Take my brother as a example, last year he went out to claim a mountain and he went with a group of people; they also hire a tour guide.	B_S0
When they cliam the mountain, my brother got lose with them and he lose his way on the mountain.	I_S0
Fortunately, the guide find their group lose a peerson very quickly because they will check the number of the people per one hour.	I_S0
So they started to find my brother and they called my brother's name very loudly and putted some sight on the trees or the roads.	I_S0
Furthermore, the guide also find a local people who familiar with the roads to help find my brother.	I_S0
Finally, they found my brother before the sun leave, it was so dangerous because there are some beasts  in the evening mountain.	I_S0
I think if my brother cliamed the mountain himself, his life will be threated.	E_S0
All in all, go to a travel in a group and led by a tour guide not only let us have more tome to enjoy  the time we travel but	O
 
As far as i'm concerned,it is a bad idea for parents to offer their children money for each high grade they get in school.	S_I0
It will make children think their study just for money.	S_T0
To begin with,it is a responsibility of student to study hard then get a great grade in examinations.	S_M0
They ought to do this although they won't get any money or some other things.	B_S1
Student  may think studying is an extra assignment to do and then not try their best to study if the parents give them extra award for studying well.	E_S1
Secondly,children may spend the money in some entertainment things,such as computer games,which has the huge bad effect on their study.	S_M0
It is clearly against the parents'original will,for it is possible to occupy students' time of studying.	S_S2
In addition, if parents keep giving the money to award children and then,one day they don't, there will emerge a conflict between parents and children,which is awful to the bond of family members.	S_M0
Besides ,if children ask more money for award one day,it is hard for parents to say "no" to their children.	B_S1
So that it puts parent in an awkward place.	E_S1
Actually , there are more better ways to express parents'happiness to students.	S_M0
For example,parents can hold a family party or invite their children's classmate to home to have a nice time.	B_S1
It is not necessary for parents to merely give the money to award children.	E_S1
In the end,i	S_S2
 
I agree with this idea.	B_T0
A man have a ability to relate well to people mean he has a high level EQ,who is more easrily to get success in future job.	E_T0
Whatever job we do,we are work with people and work for people,so build a good interpersonal relationship is really important.	S_M2
A people who can relate well to people will easier to build a good interpersonal relationship.	B_S0
If a team has a man who can relate people well,it will be running efficiently.	I_S0
Because that man will become a link between the mumber of each member,then insulates the interpersonal relationship of the team,which will provide a harmonious and stable internal environment to the team.	I_S0
Evert mumber of  the team may have a sense of belonging,they will decrease confliact to make work has high efficiency.	I_S0
That man will becomes the key part of the team,everyone like him and willing to work for him,at last he can become a leader.	I_S0
In fact,90% we learn from school can`t be used when we work,even many people`s work have nothing to do with his major.	I_S0
For example, my uncle who study math for 6 years,but when he graduated as a master,he became a chinese teacher in a high school on our town.	I_S0
He was a really good student.	E_S0
So we shouldn`t pay too much attention to our gr	O
 
My father told me that when you finished something accurately and quickly, rewards can encourage you to do better next time.	S_T1
I believe that children can achieve a betterment with rewards.	S_T0
So I thnk offering school-age children money for every good academic performance is a good idea.	S_T1
When I was a primary school student, my dad always promised me some little reward if I met his demand.	S_M1
It is an encouragement for me.	B_S0
School-age children must have things they keen on, and money is the only way to get the things they want.	I_S0
Some parents may buy it for their kids just because they like.	I_S0
However, some parents would set a goal, and tell their kids you can only get it under a prerequisite.	I_S0
For their favorite things, they will do anything to attain the goal.	I_S0
Money is a type of reward, and it is also an inspiration.	I_S0
A stuff which can satisfied them, who doesn't want it?	I_S0
So they would make efforts to studying hard, and get hogh grades in the the school.	I_S0
I remenber that my dad promised me to buy me a computer if I get 96 in the math test of mid-term exam.	I_S0
I did it, and he did send me a computer.	I_S0
He said this computer was yours, but when you failed the test next time, I would took it back, bacause this reward did not encourage you but give you negative effect.	I_S0
I was afraid of losing my computer, so I worked very hard at school, and got a higher score.	I_S0
The computer inspired me, so does money.	E_S0
The money which you bbtain through efforts can help children to make a plan about how to spend it, raise a good habit of spending money and also forbid waste of money.	S_M1
It is better to let children control their own money early, which is gain by their hardworking.	B_S1
According to the reserch, most children will cherish the thing more which is they bought with their own money, it is a reward, an encouragement, also a treasure.	E_S1
Just like earning money after you help parents do housework, money is more like a salary, a symbol.	B_C0
You make a betterment, you received salary, you do things negatively, no reward but punisnment.	I_C0
Its advantages is more than disadvantages in any case, this is why I strongly agree with this statement.	E_C0
 
when it comes to offering money to children who are at school as a result of each high grade, I definitely couldn't agree with this ideal.	S_T1
Althoug high mark children get in school emerge they are good at examination, but that doesn't mean they are hard or have good behavior.	B_T0
And it may imply a notion that we do thing for gaining money.	E_T0
Firstly, sometimes high grade doesn't show our children had improved form last examination to this one.	S_M1
At the same time, we can say they havn't tried their best to get higher level.	B_S0
Generally,  we can't judge the children only by the mark, which cause the problem whether parents offer their school-age children money.	I_S0
For example, there is one children who got a seemly high mark(91).	I_S0
But, in fact, comparing that he often get the highest mark(98) in his classroom, he had lost his mind from last peroid of examination.	I_S0
On contrary, one person who gain dramatic improvement form 40 to 70 should be rewarded.	E_S0
Secondly , the children might have been at lost if we provide much more money to them as a result of non-systematic comprehension.	S_M1
On the other way, parents could give them another gifts, such as books, pens, opportunities to travel, for providing motivition.	S_S2
Generally speaking, offering money for people's achievements is lowest way.	S_C2
Parents should focus on thire children's improvement rather than the mark.	S_S2
 
People now live a fast-paced life with much pressure, so some people think that this has led to individuals' indifference to others.	B_I0
They state that citizens are not as warm-hearted to strangers as their counterparts in the past.	E_I0
However, I can't agree this opinion from my point of view.	B_T0
I think people are actually more willing to help these days because they are more capable to offering aid and more people are encouraged by good deeds reported on the internet.	E_T0
To begin with, people now are more capable to help strangers thanks to the techonology development.	S_M1
This can offer a sense of fulfillment which encourages people to help others.	B_S0
Take my own experience as an example.	I_S0
When I was at high school, one day a young woman who lost her way asked me how to get to the train station.	I_S0
However, I was not so familiar with the city myself, which gave me little chance to help her.	I_S0
This made me feel a little embarrassed and shy to be required help from strangers.	I_S0
Several years later,some travelers at my home town asked me  where the scence spot was.	I_S0
I looked through Google Map and other applications introducing the sightseeing in my home town, and then I served them a lot of informations and instructures.	I_S0
This time I felt so proud that I was capable to help others and I began to enjoy encoutering strangers.	I_S0
People nowadays can be encouraged in the similar way.	E_S0
Moreover, with the wide spread of social network, we can see numerous reports about good deeds on the internet.	S_M1
There are also many articles and blogs written by those who get involved in helping strangers including homeless kids and the elderly, which make citizens deeply moved and want to help others themeselves.	B_S0
I used to be ignorant to beggers because I thought they didn't work hard and just waited for other people to help.	I_S0
But after I read some articles on the internet, I understood that they were also struggling to live.	I_S0
I remeber one of them lost his house in a big fire and just wanted to gather some money to cure his daughter, although his own disease was not cured yet.	I_S0
Thanks to the report, I was moved by his deep love and changed my opinion upon beggers.	I_S0
Now I am more willing to help than I used to, and I am not alone.	I_S0
I can see on internet that more and more people post their experiences of helping homeless strangers.	I_S0
I am pleased that the world is becoming warmer.	E_S0
 
With the rapid development of modern society, much ink has been spilled about the children education.	B_I0
An interesting discussion has arisen among the people: whether or not should parents endure their children to make troubles and develop themselves through these troubles.	E_I0
From my perspective, I agree with the statement that parents are supposed to let their children develop independently through some mistakes.	S_T0
Here are my main reasons for holding this opinion.	S_T1
First of all, it's inevitable for children to make some troubles in their childhood, which provides a excellent opportunity for them to explore the surroundings.	S_M1
Children may build the toy tower and destroy it to observe the physical phnenomenon, or they might try to disturb their parents' speaking to deliver their own opinions.	B_S0
These affairs might be annoying, but children gain their own knowledge through these events.	I_S0
My own experience is a compelling example of this.	I_S0
When I was a little kid, I used to be cruel to others and didn't want to play with my peers.	I_S0
Sometimes I even used the terrible word toward them, that really hurt their feelings, even my parents.	I_S0
But my parents just allowed me to learn the experience through these mistakes and left me alone.	I_S0
During the process, I recognized that I should pay respect to the relatives and I developed the sound mentality at last.	E_S0
Furthermore, children who have expericend a lot of challenges tend to have a higher persistence, which is conducive to a person's success.	S_M1
Recently, some reseachers at China Academy of Social Science conducted a survey about the relationship between childhood experience and individual characters.	B_S0
They drafted a list of questions centering on the abilities of people and asked the volunteers to fill out the questionnaire.	I_S0
Among two hundred thousand people who wrote about their own answers, nearly 90 percent people admited that the challenges and troubles they made in the childhood contribute to the persistence.	I_S0
This is a precious character to a person's future career, resembles like the concrete foundation of architecture.	I_S0
To some extent, persistence is just the premise of a bright future.	E_S0
To put it in a nutshell, I am in favor of the idea that parents are supposed to allow their childrenmake mistakes and learn by themselves through these mistakes.	B_C1
Not only because it provides a good opportunity for children to explore the interpersonal skills but also because it can cultivate their character of persistence.	E_C1
 
nowadays, some Chinese parents offer their children money for each high-grade marks they get in school.	S_I0
As a student, I suppose the way to inspire children is improper.	B_T1
at first, it may make children cheat on tests.	I_T1
then, children probably are tainted with vanity.	E_T1
besides, money is difficult to get, and children are supposed to work for something.	B_S1
the study is their own thing, getting high marks is an award for themselves, means their work getting effects.	E_S1
in my opinion, we surely need to study for our future.	S_M2
not only can we acquire more society resources, but also we can live a happy life.	B_S1
in a word, the study is for ourselves.	E_S1
 
I think parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.	S_T1
And there are several reasons.	S_T0
Firstly, this can help children to be independence.	S_M1
Because when parents give children a chance to solve a problem by themselves, children can improve the ability of independent thinking.	B_S0
When children make some mistakes, they have to solve the problems by themselves.	I_S0
Through those experiences, they were forced to think through how to solve the problems and how to avoid them later in the future instead of telling by parents.	E_S0
Secondly, children will hardly make the same mistakes again because they fix the mistakes by themselves.	S_M1
Based on they have already anlysised the situation used to faced, they will try their best to aviod making the same mistakes again.	S_S2
Thirdly, children can become more stronger when facing challenges.	B_C1
After children experienced mistakes, they will gradually grow up.	E_C1
They will not be afraid to make mistakes  will solve them confidently.	B_S1
After children grow up, find their own job, have their own family, however, parents can not always be there.	E_S1
So this is necessary	O
 
Some people in the society think that television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed.	B_T0
Maybe they think it does not make sense at all.	I_T0
However, I have a different idea that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.	I_T0
There are two reasons why I think in this way.	E_T0
Initially, telivision advertisements such as toys or game advertisement will attracte young children aged two to five and then make them addicte to the unreal word.	S_M1
It is harmful to improve chidren's social capability.	B_S0
If they addict to playing games, they will stay in the game word and do no wnt to connect with their families or friends in the real word.	I_S0
For instance, my cousin that addicted to the game do not want to go to his primary school and saty in his little room all that day.	I_S0
His parents cannot get in to his room and he does not tell a single word with his families.	I_S0
But before he saw the game advertisement on television, he got up early to go to school and played football with his friends every day after school.	I_S0
At that time, he is outgoing and popular in his school.	I_S0
That advertisement distoried him.	E_S0
Moreover, advertisement also can be harmful to children's creativity.	S_M1
for example my sister paint befor she saw a toys advertisement.	B_S0
Her painting always great and full of energy.	I_S0
But after that her painting full of that toys.	E_S0
Taking into account all the factors mentioned above, we can safely arrive teh conclusion that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.	B_C0
This is because television advertisement can make children addict to game and distroy children's social capability.	I_C0
Moreover, it also can be harmful to childre's creativity.	E_C0
 
Nowadays, most of poeple choose to relax themselves by watching movies or reading books.	S_I0
But from my stand, it's not the best way to relax ourselves.	B_T1
I always believe that nothing can be better than doing physical exercise to relieve us of pressure.	I_T1
I don't mean that most poeple are wrong.	I_T1
I think that watching a film or reading a book will make our mind tight and the result is not the one we have expect.	E_T1
But doing  physical exercise is deferent.	S_S2
First, after it, we will feel exhualsted phsically but relaxed mentally.	S_M2
Then, we will have a sound sleep.	B_S0
Next morning, we are full of energy agan.	I_S0
Second, we are changing our body conditions while working out.	I_S0
The stronger we are, the less chance we will be sick.	I_S0
It's a great deal, right?	I_S0

The energy of young people in the modern society is limited due to the high pressure of competition from their career place and school.	B_I0
Besides the pressure from coursework and jobs, the group of young people also has high possibility to get depression, which indicates the emotional illness.	I_I0
In addition, the increase of growth rate of the aging peopl divers more pressure onto the group of young people, which causes the constraints of their time availability.	E_I0
Therefore, I agree the statemtns that young people do not have sufficient time to make contribution to their communities.	S_T0
The first point that I want to emphasize is that the large amount of coursework in school occupies the time of young students.	S_M1
In the country of both China and the United States, the students from age group 10 to 17 are mandatory to spend at lease 7 hours during the weekdays on their academic studies.	B_S0
The subject of coursework includes mathematics, English, chemistry, arts and music.	I_S0
In order to get accepted by young students expected and dream universities, they are required to get excellent or at least level of good on grades from these classes.	I_S0
Young students will necessary to spend time to do well on each quizzes, homework, assignments and tests.	I_S0
Besides achieving the outstanding GPA from these subject courses, high school students need to take college placement test SAT and extend extracurricular activities in their college application, like sports and music, which will also take their time.	I_S0
Therefore, young students are unable to spend most of their time to engage in community.	E_S0
Not only young students can use to demonstrate my argument, but also those young adults who already worked in the job market will show my statement is convincing.	S_M1
Young employees in the career place are facing high competition from peer pressure.	B_S0
Their performance in the job market directly decides their salaries and future career development.	I_S0
From the perspective of young adults, supporting themselves to live in daily life independently in the society is crucal transition period for them because they would need sufficient financial conditions for supporting their own family in the future.	I_S0
Furthermore, young adults will also need to be ready for supporting their parents after they retired.	I_S0
High competition and pressure in the job market of the society are far larger than in the middle and high schools.	I_S0
There is still possibility of depression happened on those young adults since they will have emotional illness from overloading works.	I_S0
Thus, from my opinion, young adults in the society are less likely to own sufficient time on making contribution to the community service.	E_S0
High pressure from coursework towards young students and competition from career place towards young adults will cause the constraints of time on helping to the community.	B_C1
In conclusion, it is true that young people will not have enough time to spend on the community service since people's energy are limited.	E_C1
 
Presently, with the development of the society, people's life cadence become quicker and quicker.	B_I0
Therefore, few people will have time to keep in touch with their extended family.	I_I0
More and more people feels that the extended family almost play no role in their normal life, and they deems that extended family's importance is less important now than in the past.	E_I0
Nevertheless, I am fairly object to this idea.	S_T1
First and foremost, for me, as a international student, I seldom live with my parents beacuse I have to study go abroad.	S_M0
However, I am still quite young, so I need someone to take care of me.	B_S0
Therefore, I am may just familiar with my extended family, and I have to live with them to ensure my safety, and makes me grow up healthily.	I_S0
Take my own experience for example, my old brother once go to study in American, and he lives with his uncles.	I_S0
He announces that the life in that place is quite comfortable, and I even do not want to come back.	I_S0
However, before a year, I also go to the US to study.	I_S0
However, I lack the care of my extended family, because I seldom have connection with them.	I_S0
I think the life in that place is too tough, and I recognize the importance of extended family.	I_S0
Therefore, the extended family is still very important nowadays.	E_S0
Moreover, people can gain aids from their extended family when they meet the troubles.	S_M0
For example, I need some money in order to buy a brand-new computer.	B_S0
However, my parents also have no enough money to achieve my needs.	I_S0
And now, my extended family helps me a lot, because they give me abundant financial support in a bid to buy the new computer.	I_S0
Since I perchase this new computer, I can study with the aids of the computer efficiently.	E_S0
In addition, I like the atomosphere of happiness.	S_M0
In some festivals, such as the spring festival in China, people will gather together to celebrate the festival.	B_S0
The whole family will see the spring festival gala together and discuss everything they want.	I_S0
That atmosphere is so great.	I_S0
However, if we imagine that, when we lack of our extended family during the festival, we even cannot feel the festival's atomosphere of fun.	E_S0
Therefore, the extended family is very improtant to us in the pat a	S_C2
 
Some people argues that parents should take good care of children to prevent them from every dangerous things.	S_T0
While others hold that parents should let children make mistakes so they can learn from their own mistakes.	B_T1
From my perpective, I side with the latter view.	E_T1
First of all, children can learn something important from the mistakes they made.	S_M1
No one can succeed without mistakes, mistakes can help us knowing the weakness of ourselves and then we can do much better next time.	B_S0
Learning from the words of parents is not a good way for children because their own experiences can be more impressive.	I_S0
What's more, people can easily succeed if they can form a good habits, correcting their errors immediately, in their childhood.	E_S0
Secondly, everyone may make a mistake.	S_M1
We can understanding why parents don't let children make mistakes, but they can't watch their child everytime.	B_S0
Children are too young to tell right from wrong, it's easy for them making mistakes if parents ignore.	I_S0
My cousin, for example, was a naughty boy when he was young, and he would put everything in his mouth, such as pencils, leaves, papers, etc.	I_S0
His parents are too busy to take care of him so they let him make mistakes.	I_S0
When he grows older, he will know it's wrong.	E_S0
To sum up, it's an important thing	S_S2
 
People are some how complicated , but there still ways to learn about them,such as their habbits and interest..	S_I0
Some believe that by studing the types of  books and films that interests a person can facilites to learn about the person,while the others find the technique is absurd.	S_T1
I think the former groups of people are correct.	S_T0
Frist,the books and movies are created by people,a person may reading or watching them for the reason of  the perticular writer or film maker.	S_M1
By understanding the reason that a person initial motivation to read the book and watch the movie can reveal a lot more than their favorite author or derictor.	B_S0
For example, i like the moive 'shadoe' created by famous derictor Zhang Yimo, just for his use of black and white colors in the movie.	I_S0
And the reason i like the use od the colors  is becauce it is similar to the  traditional Chinese painting i like.	I_S0
So i t can learn my other interest.	E_S0
Secondly,types of books and movies can help we figure out a person's state of mind or the things he or she is going through..	S_M1
As a person is unhappy may like the comedy,because it might humor him or her.	B_S0
As for some one is very frastrated by falirure, he or she is likely turn to some books contain the ways to sucess.	I_S0
The types of  books and films could be tellers,to help us determiante the what happened to a person recently or lonng trouble him or her.	E_S0
we can also learn about his or her future form the books and movies that a person like.	S_C2

Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate:  people should follow their dreams even if the dreams are ambitious or focus on achieving realistic goals.	S_T1
Opinion varies from person to another.	B_T0
Some claims that as a young person, we should follow our dreams regardless of the difficulty.	I_T0
However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that it is better choice for people to achieve realistic goals.	E_T0
My points are elaborated as follow.	S_T1
Firstly, if the people consider theirselves able to achieve the goals, they are full of passion.	S_M1
The realistc goals are the kind of goals that the ordinary people could achieve by their deligence and talent.	B_S0
It is easier for them to disrubute their time and energy to achieve the tasks.	I_S0
Meanwile, in the way to the sucess, they could encounter the limited difficulty, which is likely to be solve easily.	I_S0
So they believe they are able to succeed, leading to the full passion.	I_S0
By contrast, if the goals are ambitious, they always seems to suspect their own ability, and at last they possibly choose to give up.	I_S0
For example, the person works in a urban city, and he are able to earn one thousand a month.	I_S0
If his goal is to buy a iphone, he could save money from the daily expense, such as the foods, the clothes and the transportation, so he believe that he could buy this cellphone only if he resist for a period of time.	I_S0
At last, he spend just half year in finishing this goals.	E_S0
In addition, the realistic goals could guarantee the people a healthy body.	S_M1
Compared with the ambitious dreams, the realistic goals is easier to achieve only if the person makes the specific plan and resists on this plan until accomplishing the goals.	B_S0
So he could distrubte himself enough time to sleep rather than working for a long time regardless of the health, which could give him a health body apparently.	I_S0
Imaging the situation, a student prepared for the final Math exam.	I_S0
Because he is not good at the Math, and he formulates a proper plan, passing the exam.	I_S0
So he could spend five hours a day to consolidate the knowledge and two hours to recall the question the teacher said in the class.	I_S0
Uner this situation, he could also guarantee a nine- hour sleep, leading to a healthy body.	E_S0
In conclusion, I must repeat my view that the p	S_C2
 
The history of a country is a very important part of the country's culture.	S_I0
And with the development of the tecenology and the ecnomic a lot of people seem to forget the history of their own coutry.	S_T1
But in my opinion I think the university student should be required to take history courses on no matter what their field.	S_T0
This is because, the history could give them a sense of  they responsibility and could let students know more the culture of their country.	S_S2
The history courses could let the student know they should devote their knowledge to build these country, because the peace of this country is very tough.	S_M1
When I study in a public high school, no matter how busy we were we will not stop the history class.	B_S0
The history teacher told us the story of the heros in our country detect the invation of the Japenese empire.	I_S0
A lot of young people devote their young life to protect the country.	I_S0
They gave up every thing of them just want to protect their country.	I_S0
The classmates of our class all feel very thanksful.	I_S0
The last generation gave up their life to provide a wonderful enviroment to us.	I_S0
We all think that we should study and contribute to our country like tham.	I_S0
Since these we study harder than before and love our country very much.	I_S0
The universities are the places that have a lot of talent, they are the future of a country.	I_S0
If they feel a sense of responsibilty to their country, they will do more things to their country.	E_S0
Second, the inforemation that we get from the history class could use in some other subject, and it could broaden our herizon.	S_M1
For example if we learn the art history, we will know a lot of painters and the famous paint of them.	B_S1
It not only could	E_S1
 
First I do not like parents who have the thngs done like this.	S_T0
I think it is very unreasonable to do it you need to let your kids to know why they are studing this and how ths can help them in the future and your guys are studing for yourself not for your parents.	S_T1
Secondly the parents are really a bad model to their kids they do things like this are telling your kids that money can make people do anythng.	S_M0
that is not right because it is very rediculous.	S_S2
Thirdly I blieve that if they raising kids in this way they will not have a very happy familly what can the parents do if their kids want more money that they can not afford?	B_M0
In fact it is a problem in China there is a lot situations like this.	E_M0
The point is how to raise a kid.	B_S0
It is very dificult problem to solve.	I_S0
I thnk it is better if you let your kid to go more place and in this way you can let your kids to know more knoledge by themself.	I_S0
It is the perfect mix of fun and learn somethings outing.	I_S0
You can make study a really interesting thing that your kidds will certainly love.	E_S0
There are many education systom in the world you may not believe it.	S_M0
I think there is no country in this world solve this problem very well it is a very difficult problem to settle but there is an old saying goes like this God helps those who help themself.	B_S1
So in this case I think it is all on your kid weather they want to study well is the key.	E_S1
All in All in from my point of view I do really not agree with that kind of parents about what they do and I also think you can study well or not it is on yourself nobody can help you with it.	S_S2
SO if you want you to have a better grades move your ase and go for it.	B_C1
That is all thank you.	E_C1
 
Some parents prefer to give their childrens pocket money when they get a high mark or grade in the school.	B_I0
According to me, it's not proper to do that.	I_I0
Above all, this activity seems can encourage students to use any possible methods to reach a high mark, which sometimes include endless constant practice or even cheating.	E_I0
Fromer not only cause less time in more effective things such as studying more or do exercices but also do harm to student's health.	S_T0
When it comes to Cheating, things may become even worse.	B_S0
As we all known, there are no parents but want thieir children to be dishonest.	I_S0
Just serveral years ago there is a child which is regarded as a genius that he is able to get into Chinese Academy of Sciences in his sixteeth.	I_S0
That is because his mother make sure his child put all of his time in studying and make him know that all his high score will be awarded.	I_S0
So poor he is!	I_S0
That genius can even unable to do anything without his mother's help.	E_S0
Besides, it follows that the student should be taught that they study only for theirselves.	S_M2
In fact, students before university are especially needed to be taught about studying for their futher to make sure that they will continue to studying hard in further learning, thus parents shound't offer their school-age children any reward for high grade or mark.	B_S0
Only by this way children will be able to positively developing for themselves.	I_S0
Last years, their is a big discussion regarding some of the students can't fit with the university life well that they can't even able to pass their test because they have been taught before they will be awarded for learing but this time they unable to get far from their parents.	I_S0
That crazy activity showing that without a acquaintance of initiative studying one cannot make a difference.	E_S0
Anyway, learing is one of the hardest thing people meet when they are young.	B_C0
So some of the parents try make it better.	I_C0
But in any case, using awarding is not a sensible way.	E_C0
 
The 21th Centry has withnessed huge social changes in every aspect in our daily life.	B_I0
And the importance of the extended family has also been put on the focal point nowdays.	I_I0
From my personal perspective, the extended family is playing a smaller role than it did in the past decade.	E_I0
First of all, due to the advanced transporation system in this informationage, people do travel a lot and many ofthem choose to move to another city, to abtain more job opportunities or better life quality.	S_M1
No longer do extend family live together.	B_S0
Although family members can still get in touch with each other via modern divices such as mobile phone whenever or wherever they want, it is seldom an easy thing for them to get together and celebrate some important festivals.	I_S0
With time went by, this long-distance relationship will gradually weaken the significance of extend family.	I_S0
The importance of extended familities fades with the busier life.	E_S0
Apart from this, with the accelerating pace of life, people are burdened with much more pressure than ever before.	S_M1
Thus, they are left with less time to main their relation ship with extene	O
 
There is no doubt that people nowadays have better lives than those who lived in the last centery.	S_I0
As a result, humanbeings have more time to enjoy themselves and they are more willing to help others, which lead to the process helping people who are poor or unstable.	S_T1
In my opnion, people today are more willing to support the struggling strangers.	S_M1
The most and foremost reason is that the civiliation of the society has developed and what people concern are not whether they are able to make livings for themselves but who to make their lives more meaningful.	B_S0
As the saying goes,"everyone born with a sinserely heart."	I_S0
That's why we have a series of charity organizations.	I_S0
One had surplus energy are more glad to join in the member of the charity groups.	E_S0
Morover, helping others may not be a difficult thing.	S_M1
that will give him(her) more probabilities to get others help.	B_S0
People who need help may not just want money, they may just find thirsty and need some water.	I_S0
We have no reason to refuse them.	E_S0
Helping strangers sometimes can get unpredicted receive.	B_C0
The man who usually help others will be regarded as a good person.	I_C0
And when he is in trouble, people surounded him are usually willing to help him out.	I_C0
What's more, the man may find his wife easily.	E_C0
 
I think it's alright for parents to give thier chilchren money as a rewarding of high grades, but the money shouldn't be too much.	S_T1
Absolutely, the first thing parents should do is to help thier children build right view of money.	S_T0
First of all, rewarding gains school-age children confidence and desire.	S_M1
Using money as the reward certainly joy children, from which them know that they would be rewarded by monry when they get good grade.	B_S0
After realizing this, most children work hard on their academic in order to get thier reward.	I_S0
It is a virtuous cycle that children would have stable good grade and more desire to keep going on.	E_S0
Also, using money as reward is a good opportunity to build children's view of money.	S_M1
Toys, game players or any other things like these are not as meaningful and educative as money.	B_S0
With thier patrents' guide, children will quickly know how to use money exchanging other things they want, which is certianly an important part of education during thier growth.	I_S0
However , there are great possibilities that children indulge in money so parents must act like a severe supervisor when thier children start to use money.	I_S0
A effective way to reduce the risk is to minimize the money children can get.	I_S0
With few money, there won't have many things that they can afford.	I_S0
In this condition, parents can also teach thier children to save thier money, this helpful to thier good habit on using money.	E_S0
In the conclusion, providing school-age children money as encouragement for thier high grade is not a bad thing.	B_C1
With proper guide and supervisision, it's helpful no matter in children's academic study or building a right moral of the world.	E_C1
Altough this require parents to have resiponsibility=	S_S2
 
It is an absolute fact that an increasing number of poeple nowadays are indulged in daily works, resulting in the rapid development of the society and human improvement, at the same time, most of us have a tendency to choose the types of works between similar tasks and various tasks.	B_I0
Compared to the pat time when people were accustomed to a single work, more and more poeple would like to satisfy themselves by doing a variety types of tasks.	E_I0
For one reason, people nowadays have more flexible time to devote them into the family and the society, we can use the limited time efficiently rather than repeat the same work every day and night.	S_M1
For an example, a casher can write books late into the night after their work in the supermarket, also a fisher can use them extra time to teach students how to swim in the swimming pool after preying.	B_S1
Flexible works determine the amount of time we can make full use of ,so why we do not try something new to kill the boring time?	E_S1
In addition, many citizens or youngsters have tons of pressures because of the repeated work , the intensive works make them weak, tired, and out of breath sometimes.	S_M1
Different types of tasks mean that we have more choices toword career development, if we get failed in a position, we would better switch to another job , even it is not relevant to the former work experience.	B_S0
Howerver, similar work restricts our choices, resulting from the grey occupation we never set foot in.	I_S0
Different types of tasks make us clear and force us a solid foundation for the possibilities.	E_S0
So sum up, I may recommend that we should better satistify ourselves in various types of tasks but not a similar tasks which will dimish our morales day by day.	S_C2
 
As for me, I support the idea that parents should let children make mistakes and learn from what they have done.	S_T0
Nowadays, too many parents want to protect their chilren and won't let them many mistake, because they think some mistake probably hurt children on both body and mental health.	B_T1
I think these activities will spoil children.	E_T1
Making mistake is before making a progress.	S_T0
First and foremost, let children make mistakes can let them initiatively know they are wrong.	S_M1
If you always "protect" them.	B_S0
Perhaps they can't figure out what is right or wrong.	I_S0
At the beginning, they keep making mistakes and realize that they are wrong, then correct them.	I_S0
After many times, I think less mistakes they will make.	E_S0
Moreover, making mistake  can train your abilities and let you remember the mistake.	S_M1
Take my cusin for examply.	B_S0
At the beginning of that he learn swimming, he always make a mistake on the movement on his legs.	I_S0
This mistake results in that he can't float on the surface of water.	I_S0
His father buy him a swimming circle and solve the problem.	I_S0
One month later, when he take away the swimming circle, to our surprise, he still can't swim.	I_S0
his father got mad and threw away his swimming circle.	I_S0
At first, he struggled in the water but after he drank lots of water, he did realize that he have to change the way he behave.	E_S0
These two points I think can support that parents should let children make mistakes.	S_C2
 
I disagree with the statement that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers, followed by three reasons.	B_I0
Firstly, the rhyme of modern life becomes quicker so people pay more attention to their work and wouldn't stop their path to help struggling strangers.	I_I0
With the development of society, citizens have to face a range of living problems and they are all struggling to meet the living requirements.	I_I0
With the numberous work, people have no spare time to care about the strangers.	I_I0
For example, if you are on the way to the company, would you really be willing to spend your little time on a losting older, which leads to a unsure consequence?	E_I0
Balancing the feedback with the time you spend, the decision must be a dilemma.	S_T1
Secondly, the risk of helping strangers becomes higher than the past.	S_M1
There are plenty of real cases that the criminals utilized the compassion of victims to conduct crime.	B_S0
Some criminals may pretend struggling strangers to approach victims.	I_S0
Owing to these widespreaded cases, citizens prefer to protect themselves and decide not to be involved with the potential risk.	I_S0
And they always believe that only the police can help those who are struggling.	I_S0
Hence, people are used to refuse the ask for helping from strangers.	E_S0
Thirdly, nowadays people care more about the feedback of what they have done.	S_M1
Since the majority take the packback after the pay-out for granted, there are increasingly people who will struggle the feedback with the pay-out before they help strangers.	B_S0
If the consequence is negative and filled with risk, they prefer to ignore it.	I_S0
This kind of situation may be caused by the change of whole social environment.	I_S0
Human tend to care more about the feedback.	I_S0
And they are not willing to pay out for the struggling strangers.	E_S0
 
At present, a controversial topic has aroused aheated debate: whether increasing the price of gasoline and electricity is the most effective way for the officials to encourage energy conservation.	B_I0
Answers vary from one to another.	I_I0
Some people claim that raising the prices of pertroline and electricity is indeed the most effective method for goernment.	E_I0
However, contrary to their views comes my own perspective that there are other more effective way to help governors to resolve the problem of energy conservation.	B_T0
My viewpoint is based on the following reasons.	E_T0
First, publishing some laws to prevent the waste of energy should be taken into consideration by the government.	S_M1
To be more specific, when governors stipulate some relevant laws and decrees,  people will increase their awareness of saving power and energy since if someone violates the decrees and disciplines, he or she will be punished or sentenced.	B_S0
However, if government only raise the fees of electricity and gasoline, some people don't care for the little increase of the prices compared to the huge profits of some illegal industries.	I_S0
For example, there was a factory near my hometown which generated plastic products for using only once.	I_S0
Every year the factory pour the gasoline into rivers to decrease the cost, which cause waste odf ene.	I_S0
After the relevant laws and regulation of the government, the factory stopped its production for fear of large amount of fines and then chose another business.	E_S0
Second, developing high-technology which is used to save energy is also a better choice for the governors.	S_M1
Specifically, by funding on the research of some technology which aim for energy conservation, the government is more likely to put them into practice in the near future.	B_S0
In this case, the new inventions can not only save the exiseted energy but also make a huge amount of profits since people come to buy these products and then government could have extra funds to invest other research, which could form a positive circulation.	I_S0
For example, after research of so many years, the cars powered by electricity come into the markets.	I_S0
This kind of cars don't need gasoline any more and they won't charge for a long time.	I_S0
Thanks to the investment from the government, the research on this kind of cars could go on well without the concern of lack money.	E_S0
In conclusion, there are still other better choices for the government to encourage the energy conservation such as publishing laws and deceloping some technology.	S_C2
 
When asked about their attitude about what benefit can students get from student organization and club activities, they always stay uncertain.	S_I0
Some mention that students can learn as much as their academic studies, but from my prespective, academic studies will benefit much more than these student organization and club activities.	S_T1
To begin with, the more student acquire about their academic studies, the higer chance for them to land on a high-paid job.	S_M0
It is obvious that in this money-oriented market, what corporations really care about is the individual's mastery, which means that only one's academic studies matters in future life.	B_S0
For example, nowadays, English is widely required for employees, if one spend too much time on student organization and club activities, there remains little time to get acquire of English.	I_S0
The higer the salary is, the more skills are required.	I_S0
Thus it is obvious that students can not learn these academic skills in student organization.	E_S0
Furthermore, academic studies provides students with the chance to get access to those specialists and learn some personality from them.	S_M0
It is hard to imange that without academic studies, how can these students at that age get these precious chances to learn form these masters.	B_S0
However, student organization can not let students learn and acquire knowledge from them.	I_S0
Anyway, these professors do have much more knowledge than students,	E_S0
Last but not least, it is more likely for students to play with others rather than get benefit from others.	S_M0
Take myself as an example.	B_S0
Once I joined a study group in order to improve my English, and at the beginning of the study, we can spend time on reading and writting.	I_S0
However, with we getting familiar with each other, we gradually begin chatting and playing with others, and finally I learned little from this activites.	E_S0
All in all, academic studies can benefit more for students compared to student organization.	S_C2
 
With the development of life quality, the demand of children is increasing.	B_I0
And a problem whether parents offer cash to their  children causes a hot debate among people.	E_I0
In my opinion, that's not a great ideal.	S_T1
It's not benefitcial for humans' development.	S_M2
If kids get money easily, they will consider that getting money is not a big isssue.	B_S1
This can not tell right and wrong to kids.	E_S1
 
As the different family may have different ways to educate children, the question whether parents should let childre make mistakes so that they could learn from their own mistakes is a highly debated one.	S_I0
Some people contend that letting children make mistakes is not a good way because the children should not face with too many difficulties in that young age, otherwise they are easy to be upset.	S_T0
However, as far as I am concerned, it is significant for children to meet problemd directly and independently.	B_T1
In this way, they can be more persistent in the future and they will remember the experience forever.	E_T1
Above all, children will learn to be diligent and persistent when the parents let children make their own mistakes.	S_M0
As an old saying goes, nothing in the world is impossible if you set your mind to do it.	B_S1
During the process when children make mistakes and draw experience from it, they will gradually understand the meaning of the saying above.	E_S1
Moreover, it is sure that children will remember it forever if they learn from their own mistakes.	S_M0
For example, my parents just let me make mistakes when I was in a young age.	B_S0
I was addictive to the video games at that time, but my parents never said anything about it.	I_S0
However, after an important examination, I found that my grades were so bad that I dare not tell these to my parents!	I_S0
Finally, I understood that the video games were just the obstacle in the way to success and I tried my best to remove myself from the games.	I_S0
It was not easy but at last I succeed in doing it and I will never forget the miserable process.	I_S0
Thanks to my parents, their special way of education helped me a lot.	I_S0
They let me make mistakes and let me learn from it on myself and I will remember it forever that I should not be addictive to anything.	E_S0
Admittedly, children may be upset if they make mistakes and their parents do not help them.	S_M0
However, when children realize that they should face the problem on thier own, they tend to be effective and persistent.	B_S0
It will leave them deeper impression after they solve the problem on themselves and learn from the mistakes.	I_S0
As a result, the disadvantages of being upset are outweighed by the benefits of their learning from the mistakes.	E_S0
To sum up, it is better for parents to let the children make mistakes.	B_C1
Although this way of educating their children seems to be sort of strange, it is effective and it will pave the way for children's brilliant future.	E_C1
 
I disagree with the statement which takes watching a movie or reading a book better than doing physical exercise to relax.my reasons are as follow:	S_S2
in the first place,it is well-known that doing exerses is benificial to our human body.	S_I0
by doing exerses we can not only keep in fit but also sleep sound at night,people who takes exerses usually can keep in energitic, no wonder there is a idiom saying that lives lie in movement.	B_T1
by doing exersece, we can flee from the dark and plaint daily routines, and get wel refreshed.	E_T1
further more, we are used to live a sitting lifestyle, it is time for us to go outside and absorb the fresh air, we can admire the beauty of the nature which is tend   to be ignored in our daily life,it is a fatastic way to keep our physical as well as physilogical health.	S_M1
what is more,we can make more friends by doing outdoor activitie,making ourselves	S_S2
at last but not least, the reason i am opposite to relax by watching a movie or reading a book is that people may get addicted to moives and books.	S_M1
moies and books are favoured for their exciting plots, and we can be distracted when doing something needs concentration by recalling the plots of movies and books, although we have a relaxed time watching a movie or reading a book, we waste more time in delete the negative effect they made, that is obviusly not a good choice for us.	B_S2
all in all, relaxing by doing physical is the most wise method compared to watching a movie or reading a book, in which you can hold health, slim body,confidence,good emoion at the same time.	E_S2
 
It is universally acknowledged that before the future job you have two choice one is relate well to people other one is studying hard in the school.	B_T1
Some people who believed that are many people think to relate  well to people is improtant in  a future job.	I_T1
On contrary, i perfer to believed that studing hard in school is important than the ability to relate well to people .	E_T1
that is mainly because study some knowledge is important than to make good friendship when in you future job.	S_T0
At first place, we study in the school can get many knowledge ,we learn  in many classrooms and work hard everyday.	S_M1
Also ,study in the school is amount to accumlate some job experience  is very basically.	S_S2
Moreover, studying hard in school is important than relate well to people .	S_M1
If you have very good friendship in your future job, but your ability of work is not very good ,sometimes your workmate cannot help you to work .	B_S0
At that time is feel very badly who before the work not studying hard in the school.	I_S0
Studying hard in the school can made you have many knowledge and  can make friend just no to focus on to relate well to people is well.	I_S0
when you get a good job ,you can relate weel to people is well.	I_S0
But  i think studying hard is basic to you friendship.	E_S0
Lastly, i think studying hard	O

Issues related to leadership have never failed attract people' s attention.	B_I0
Recently, a heated debate topic arose in the public: whether people can learn to be a leader or not.	I_I0
Opinions vary from one to another.	E_I0
Some people argue that leadership comes naturally.	B_T0
However, in the ultimate analysis, I contend that people are able to learn to be a leader.	E_T0
My points can be liiustrated as follow.	S_T1
To begin with, it is easy for people to become leaders in travelling.	S_M1
To be more specific, travelling leaders need people to have the ability of communicating with others logically and efficiently.	B_S0
It is well known that people can improve their level of talking by lots of methods.	I_S0
It is useful for people to communicate more with others to do this, as when people talk with others, they have to organize their words, come up with the proper sequence then speak out to express their ideas, by doing which frequently they can do better in talking logically.	I_S0
In addition, reducing nosence helps people to talk more effectively.	I_S0
For people can just show their important perspectives to others, which is very brief.	I_S0
Thus, others are more possible to understand them.	I_S0
Therefore, for people, improving their skills in communicating is easy, which makes them able to become leaders in travelling.	E_S0
In the second place, people can become acedemic leaders with little effort.	S_M1
As academic leaders need people to have high level of education in order to help others who are leaded by them.	B_S0
So it is accessible for people to own the high level of knowledge by studying hard.	I_S0
Take myself as an example, when I was in high school, I studied English very hard, I digested all knowledge in time and listened to my teachers very carefully in class.	I_S0
As a result, I had enormous knowledge of English.	I_S0
Then my English teahcher assigned me as a leader of English subject.	I_S0
Since she said that I was knowledgeable enough in English so that I could assist others classmates with their tasks and could offered them help in their homework.	I_S0
Moreover, I worked very well as a academic leader.	I_S0
Thus, it is simple for people to become a academic leader.	E_S0
To conclude, judging from all the reasons I listed above, I strongly believe that	O
 
As the world keeps moving on,the ''newbies'',aka the kids are struggling to keep up with the world,it is the parents job to make sure their kids are ready to take on the challenges life has to offer.	S_I0
i think the best way to do so is for the parents to let their children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.	S_T1
First and foremost,it is in the children`s nature to make mistakes.	S_M0
they see new things for the first time,study it, get to know it,then make their first attempt to handle it.	B_S1
but the truth is nobody is born with the talent and knowledge of everything,thus mistakes are unavoidable.	E_S1
Second,there is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of if you make some mistakes,instead you should embrass them,for thay offer you an opportunity to learn and be better.	S_M0
so parents should let their children make mistakes and learn instead of forcing their kids to be the perfect in every aspect which,as mentioned before,is unlikely.	B_S1
when a mistake is made by the kids,the parents should let them know the consequence of their mistakes after garanteeing the permission to make mistakes,talk them through the hard part and enable them to avoid making the same mistake from now on.	E_S1
Third,it is proved that kids learn better and grow faster after making mistakes because they tend to remember the lesson more clearly once being yelled at or grounded.	S_M0
i remember when i broke my mom`s vase,i had to take charge of the house cleaning for aproximately a month.	B_S1
as a result,i learn how to behave around the house and that you can never be too careful around the delicate objects.	E_S1
In concusion,i`m convinced that the parents should have the kids be comfortable making mistakes and learn from their own mistakes.	S_C2
 
Some school-age children has been deemed that they could increase one score if they were give one dollar from their parents.	B_I0
Of course,rewards play a vital role in stimulating children's learning.	E_I0
However,I think that it does have negative influence on children's mental growth in the long term.	S_T0
On the one hand, he forms the habit of exchanging his good grades for additional money he will be used to measure everything totally by money.	S_M1
Gradually ,he will turn out to be a money person.	B_S1
So,doyou think him to grow up to be a person of kindness?	E_S1
On the other hand,if he can't achieve the goals all the time,he will ultimately look down on himself and lose self-confidence,especially when he has brother who always  excellenter more then he.	S_M1
But he doesn't konw that,in fact,it is not because he doesn't pay enough effort but he lacks interest in these areas.	B_S1
Under this circumstance,what a wise parent should do is to give him freedom rather tahan to put hight preesures.	E_S1
 
I  agree  with the poin that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.	S_T0
Children always make mistakes which was very noamal .	B_T1
Ever body has his or her childhood ,we learn much from kinds of fault .	E_T1
When  I  was a child .	S_M1
My father was very  serious to me that  I was always afraid  of  making  mistakes .	B_S0
I tried my best to do what he said to avoid his blame .	I_S0
I draw pictures as teacher told me even I have my own idea because in that way I would  not  make any fault .	I_S0
One day  ,my mother found that I was so sared of to be myself ,she encouraged me to be bave ."	I_S0
Just  to  enjoy the taffs you like ".	I_S0
She said .	I_S0
Then I  created some inteseting pictures which ever praised by my teather .	I_S0
And now  I am good at  drawing which helps me a lot during my career .	E_S0
Many  creations are invented  during  numerous mistakes .	S_M1
Things are not easy tobe done smoothley .	B_S0
I firmly believe that it is mistake that help people find the coreect ways to succeed.	I_S0
Just as the saying goes ,you want to learning swimming,you have to drink some water in the pool .	I_S0
If  you don't make any mistake  ,you will not make any progress.	E_S0
Now  I  am a mother of two children .	B_C0
I always ask them to try what them want ,just be sue that is safe .	I_C0
The world is new for them .	I_C0
Life is full of  problems  which parents can always helo them to  solve .	E_C0
Experencing  different chanllenges  is good  for our children .	S_S2

The education has been playing and will continously play a vital role in the development of a country.	B_I0
Recently, here comes up a saying that it is the best method to increase teachers' salaries for promoting the quality of education in a country.	E_I0
As far as I am concerned, the statement makes sense.	S_T0
In the first place, getting teachers' income higher can show the positive attitude of the government towards education, since it is the attitude that decides the result of one thing.	S_M0
If the salaries of teachers were improved, the local governments would recognize the revolution of the central government.	B_S0
Then, the local governments would pay more efforts in the local education.	I_S0
For instance, in 2015, giving 3 million to the government of our city, the central government requested that the salaries be increased.	I_S0
Our city government, in this way, not only improve the teachers salaries, but also put more money in the education field.	E_S0
Second of all, for teachers themselves, although they are contributing themselves to the career, it is not doubtful that they will concerntrate more on the education if their income is higher.	S_M0
There is an old saying in China that money can make a ghost do housework.	B_S0
Image that, if a teacher gets more rewards and his or her life goes more smoothly, is there any reason that he or she can't concentrate more on the career?	I_S0
As a consequence, the quality of the teacher's courses nataturally becomes much more significant.	E_S0
Finally, the higher salaries of teachers will attract more people to study to become teachers, which means that the threshold of being a teacher will followingly increase.	S_M0
the more people dive into the teacher positions, the more elites will show up in such a field.	B_S1
For example, there is no doubt that there are more outstanding teachers picke up in 100 persons than 50 ones.	E_S1
In a word, it is necessary to increase teachers' salaries for promoting the au	S_C2
 
We have to admit that though some great things are brought, the development of all aspects of the society also caused  more and more work waiting for us to solve.	S_T1
So it seems that we have to be equiped with the abilities to plan and organize.	B_T0
I totally agree with that statement, as far as I am concerned, those kinds of abilities can benefit us in may aspects.	E_T0
First and formost, when people have lots of things to deal with, the ability to plan and organize can help to solve problems in order.	S_M1
There are times when things crushed in, and maybe people will have no idea of how to handle such a huge number of things, and be freaked out or even drived to crazy.	B_S0
But with the ability to plan and organize, things can be done perfectly.	I_S0
When I was a freshmen two years ago, I decided to major in two descplines, and immediately after the decision was made, I found there were large amount things wait me to do.	I_S0
I had classes all day long, I had lots of assignment, and I had to study for some extra competitions and tests.	I_S0
So I made a form, deciding the importance and urgency of each thing , making a sequence and filling every blank in details, so when I saw it, I knew what to do next.	I_S0
That really helps in my hardest time.	I_S0
So the ability of planing and organize things is quite important.	E_S0
Secondly, when people are facing something of significance, they have to have the abilities of planing and organization.	S_M1
People always get nervous and anxious when they are faced with important things such as a meeting or an interview.	B_S0
What my uncle does is that everytime when he has something improtant, he gets the full preparation in advance.	I_S0
When he is going to have a meeting, he will pick the right suit the night before and iron them.	I_S0
And he will get uo early to review what he is going to say in the meeting to make sure he wouldn't make any mistakes.	I_S0
To conclude, it's really helpful when people know what to do and plan everything in order.	I_S0
Just as the saying goes, the success is ready for man who gets the preparation, everyone should learn how to organize and plan to make sure everything is right.	E_S0
Definitely , nothing is more important than planing and organizing when we are surrounded with lots of stuff and don't know what to do.	B_C0
With the ability of these, we will be seen as meticulous and rational.	I_C0
It will become more easier for us to success in career and we can arrange our lives better in that way.	E_C0
 
I agree to the statement that celebrities are more important to younger people instead of older people.	S_T0
First and foremost, the younger people, like teens shows more interest in stars compare to the elder one , or you can say:the things or people they like ,such as entertainers .	B_S0
For example, in nowdays , every teens had their superstar, every entertainers has their fans ,especially the younger one.	I_S0
That's one thing that we can't ignore.	I_S0
The younger people want to know them want to love them ,they will spend money and time  on them, like CDs , tickets of the tour and all other stuff.	I_S0
Theses evdences shows that famous entertainers have more influence on the younger people.	E_S0
Secondly,one celebritie can creat amount of jobs.	S_M1
Such as athletes.	B_S0
Teens do more excersice than the older people since the older people are not likely do excersice usually, so that means teenager love sports than the elder people.	I_S0
One sport can creat a lot of athletes.	I_S0
For example, in China ,basketball  created at least a thousand jobs for teens, evry province, or even every college has their teem for just one sports, just imagine 30 sports can creat how many jobs for teens.	I_S0
But talking to the older ones , they already has their job , so these are no matter for them.	E_S0
For the last,we all know that younger people have ethusiasm about everything especially the new things.	S_M1
Famous movies stars of singers or bans or athletes are their favorite,unlike the older people , they have no patien on anything except one they have ablilty to finish , but just using the word" Finish."	S_S2
So that is why I agree with this a statemen.	S_C2
 
I do not think it is a good idea.	S_T1
It has no doubt that parents can stimulate children to study hard in this way.	B_S0
However, if parents continue to offer children money for each high grade, children will have a wrong thought that they study hard for money, not for themselves, not for their future.	I_S0
Anyway, some parents take too much attention on the high grades in school, but what really matters is the ability of students.	I_S0
Studying hard is not for high grades and money, but for building ourselves.	I_S0
As for school-age children, unfortunately, most of them do not have such a realization on the meaning of study, but offering money is not the noly way to make them hard-working.	I_S0
For example, parents can let their children join some social activities in which may use the knowledge they have learned, so after them, they will realize that the knowledge they have learned is very important.	I_S0
This thopught can play a great role in their study in future.	I_S0
In addtion, parents can make the process of study more interesting, so that children may l	E_S0
 
At present, there is an phenomenon that some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.	S_I0
To my way of thinking, I think it's a very good idea.	S_T0
Firstly, when parents use money as award, it shows thier satisfaction most directly, which can stimulate children in their future study as well.	S_M1
In most ways, money shows value.	B_S0
And once children receive money from their parents, they can easily find that their high grade in school is something valuable, so it's becoming a motivation in their future study.	I_S0
They will always put study in a very important place.	E_S0
Secondly, it gives children more fexible choices to reward themselves when they have money on their own.	S_M1
I remember the time when I got a very good grade in junior middle school.	B_S0
When my father came to pick me up, he gave me a quite expensive stuffed dog as a reward.	I_S0
I was happy, but not that much.	I_S0
I thought that if I have that money, I would certainly buy myself a better thing.	I_S0
And as times changing, chilrdren now have much more ideas on their own, so it's absolutely better for parents to give the choices to childre Last but not least, the best thing both parents and children can do with the money is that parents teach their children how to use it well, from which children can undoubtedly learn a lot, which enables them arrange their future life better.	E_S0
 
When it comes whether spending money to improve Internet access is better than to improve public  transportation.	B_I0
The disscussion over this issue procokes widespread concern od individuals and society.	I_I0
Some hold that  spending money to improve public transportation is more important but the opponents cast doubt on this satement.	E_I0
After weighing the corns and pros, I think spending the money to improve public tranportation can makes more benefits.	S_T1
To begin with, to improve the public transportation can save poeple's time.	S_M2
As we know, many poeple go to work by taking  bus or the subway.	B_S0
This  situation influence the bus and the subway are not enough for people.	I_S0
So it is always crowed on the bus and the subway.	I_S0
As we can see, if we are bwaiting a long time that we can get in to the bus or the subway, but we can not get in because the bus  not fit I think if the government spend more money to improve the public transportation can	E_S0
From what we disscussed above, we may draw the conclusion that spending the moeny to improve public tranceportation is more beneficial than to improve Iternet access.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, people are busy with their work and study, so they try to find several ways to relax like shoping, watching movies and doing sports.	S_T0
Some people choose travel, and they think travel it is a best to have a guid  on the travel.	S_I0
I admit that it is a good choice to take a guide,but I do not think it is the best way.	B_T0
In fact, there are many ways to travle, such as traveling with good friend.	E_T0
First, travling with a tour guide, you can avoid many problems.	S_M2
That is becaue tour guid will arrange all the schedule about this travle, so we don't warry about how to make a plan by our selves.	B_S0
Tour guides are really familiar with local culture, food or transportation, so they can help us to enjoy the tour.	I_S0
If we arrange the plan by ourselves, we may meet some problems, like not familiar with locle transportation.	I_S0
for example I went Ameria last sammer vacation by myself.	I_S0
After I go abroad, I think I could go to the famous site by subway.	I_S0
But when I arrived at the subway station, there are so many people that I could not get in subway.	I_S0
It is not as convenient as I think.	I_S0
If I had gone abroad with a tour guide I would have saved lot of time.	E_S0
On the other hand,	S_S2
 
Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among public:  should people follow their dreams even if the dreams are ambitious of just focus on achieving realistic goals.	B_T0
Opinions vary from person to person.	I_T0
Some claims that it is better to focus on achieving realistic goals because it is easier in daily life.	I_T0
However, i would hold an oppsite view that it is much more important to follow people's dream even if the dream is hard to achieve.	E_T0
First, following your dreams means that people are doing something that they are really interested in, whcih means they can be extremely enjoyable.	S_M1
Chasing your dreams shows that you are following your heart and you actually know what impress you.	B_S0
Some people  just finish some realistic goals that they don't like and they even don't know why they have to finish these goals, which is the worst thing in one's life.	I_S0
At least from my perspective it is.	I_S0
Mayun, the most famous seller in China, are always following his dreams.	I_S0
At his twenties years old, he wanted to establish a company that can change the state of shopping in China.	I_S0
No one supported him and some of his good friends tried to let him back to be an English teacher again.	I_S0
But he fellow his dreams and made efforts to achieve it.	I_S0
When he shared the stories of himself in my university, he said that chasing the dreams are the happiest thing in the world.	I_S0
Everyone should know that only can you enjoy your life by following your dreams.	E_S0
Second, following the dreams that even may seem ambitious can make person to meet the better one of his own.	S_M1
It is believed that if you consistantly try your best to focus on one thing, you will make a dramaticly  surprising process in this field.	B_S0
My high school classmates Li and Hu, who are both really interested in playing the piano.	I_S0
However, Li has been learning to play the piano for ten years and now can give a wonderful performance in front of people, while Hu just think he is not talented enough to learn well in playing the piano and give up playing and just focus on something that seems like easier or more realistic in his mind.	I_S0
So, if you just follow your ambitious dream, even if it may be difficult to achieve, nothing possible.	E_S0
In summary, from what has been discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that following dreams even if the dreams are ambitious can lead to a better life.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.	S_I0
And I think it is a good way.	B_T0
I agree with that without any hesitates.	I_T0
I would accout for my opinion.	E_T0
Firstly, offer children money can encourage them to study harder, as long as they get benefit from the high grade, they would effort for the reward.	S_M1
For example, when I was a teenager, something relax was my favorite so that I spent all the time in that.	B_S0
Of course that made me a bad mark.	I_S0
Worrying about my furture, my parents told me that if I got a high grade,they would reward me some money I can use by myself.	I_S0
To be honest, I didn't have any  money before that and lots of thing I was interested need money.	I_S0
With this motivation, I became a hardworking student.	I_S0
At the moment I got the money for my mark, I realized that it is very useful for me to study.	E_S0
Secondly, that way can make children know how to use their money for the best benefit early.	S_M1
I was also a good example.	B_S0
After I had some money, I started to ponder how I use them.	I_S0
The money was diffcult to earn and it was also limited.	I_S0
That was obvious to know the importance of how to use them.	I_S0
In that case, I gave my mother some of them to depoist and I could get interest to expand my fund.	I_S0
Besides that, I made a hard decision about what the thing I want to posses most.	I_S0
Then I chose the noval I long for for a long time.	E_S0
Last thing is, the most of the student are too young to realize the significance of the study.	B_C0
That why you should give them some prize to encourage them.	I_C0
Ortherwise, they may be think study is painful and boring, just like my classmate, Penny, with no money for high grade and hate the school, then she dropped out the school.	E_C0
 
I think that watching movies and reading books definitely have more advantages than doing physical exercise.	S_T1
There are actually many reasons that I can list, however, I just illustrate some of them.	S_T0
By reading books, you can not only relax your body but also fulfill your knowledge.	S_M0
For example, I used to be interested in history when I was about ten.	B_S0
I always went to the school library after class.	I_S0
seriously, I got a lot of precious information about ancient China, like the poet LiBai, the powerful denisty of Qin, the love story of famous people.	I_S0
Thanks to these accumulation, teachers praised me for my writing material and gave me a high core.	I_S0
In my opinion, different books can provide different aspects of knowledge with you.	I_S0
You are able to get access to awesome science through scientific books, you wil have chances to swim in the sea of love by reading romatic books, you can also experience a strange travel through a novel.	I_S0
It is fantastic, isn't it?	I_S0
Unfortunately, I don't think that sports can promise these achivements.	E_S0
Besides reading, watching movies is also a good choice for most people.	S_M0
Fantastic pictures, interesting plot, moving story, exciting war always attract me a lot.	B_S0
My favorite movie is Harry Potter which is also one of the most poppular sery of book in the world.	I_S0
It always give me a feeling that I am the hero in that movie and it's me who saves the whole world.	I_S0
Although it is silly, it is also fun!	E_S0
What I think is the most obvious advantage of watching a movie or reading a book is that it won't make you exhausted like doing exerice.	S_M0
Imagine that you have studied or worked all day, you just want to lie down and give yourself a good rest.	B_S0
Will you choose to play basketball for another one hour?	I_S0
I believe you won't.	I_S0
Making delicious snacks and finding a comfortable position to sit and then reading a book seems a better choice.	I_S0
You are able to relax your body and peacify your mind.	E_S0
Anyway, exercise is essential to our health.	B_C0
When you are free, you may give yourself a chance to do some sports.	I_C0
But I recommand you to read a book or watch a movie when you want to truely relax yourself.	E_C0
 
With improvement of technology, young people have easy access to knowledge than in the past.	S_I0
So a controversial topic arouses a debate: whether the young people today are more likely to invest their time and efforts in improving the world than young people in the past.	S_T1
Some people think that young people in the past are more willing to improving the world.	B_T0
But I hold the view that   youth today is more likely to invest their time and effort in developing the world.	I_T0
My view can be illustrated as follows.	E_T0
To begin with, nowadays, youth have more chance to get access to the advanced technology and resource than before.	S_M1
They can join the program with the help of professor and get information from the internet so that they are willing to invest their time and effort to developing the world.	B_S0
On the other hand, young people  in the past have less chance to get education, even know about the developed technology, they will less likely to invest their time and efforts to developing world.	I_S0
For instance, I have ever joined in the program to improve the enviroment situation in the China, with the help of professor and local government, we organized many people plant trees.	I_S0
In this year, I got the report that the sandstorm in Bejing is less than five years ago.	I_S0
But, my mother when she was young has no chance to enter the university.	E_S0
In addition,  the policy from government is friendly for young people to improve the world than that in the past.	S_M1
So young people in recent have greater passion on improving world.	B_S0
They can easily get fund from the government and other agency, and that will motivate young people involving themsevles in world development.	I_S0
However, in the past, government had not enough fund to help youth.	I_S0
For instance, my uncle want to invent a machine to improve the air condition in the room, so he appiled the study fund.	I_S0
He get the money quickly and finish his invention on time.	I_S0
With the policy, my uncle wants to continue his inventing work.	E_S0
To sum up, young people currently is more likely to invest their time and eff	O
 
Some people may agree that parents in the past were more involved in children's education than parents today.	S_T0
However,throughout my own investigation and observation,I hold an opposite idea.	S_T1
As far as I'm concerned, parents  in this era are more carefully and entirely dedicate themselves to their children's education.	S_T0
This is a high-technology period with too much competition,if parents want their children to live a  better life, they have to force them to well equipped with abundant knowledge,on the other hand,providing high quailty education has already become one of the policy in the majority countries in the world,parents can afford their children to gain better education.	S_T1
Firstly,parents hope to give their children a better life by providing them sufficient edcation.	S_M2
Knowledge equals to power in our society,which means if someone longs a satisfying job and a cozy room,he surely needs the same quailty of education expericence and diploma.	B_S0
I can raise an example easily.	I_S0
Years ago,my friend whom I always called 'Fish' wished to keep on learning playing the violin,she searched on the Internet about some colleges in China.	I_S0
However,she eventually found that it's hard to find a well-paid job if she studys in those low-quality education school.	I_S0
Finally,she learned Franch herself and soon past the level test,at the same time,she handed in her scores and some needed information to the music school in France.	I_S0
Now she graduate and come back to China,she find a job outside a high school,teaching students playing the violin and providing them chances to do their like.	E_S0
Secondly, education has already become one of the main problems globally,as a responsible government,they provided parents and children enough access to	O
 
As time flow, young there are more changes in this society.	S_I0
For young people, they had not enough resource to look for their future life in the past.	S_S1
And things changes, more and more people are more accessible to information.	S_I0
Some people think young people overly depended on their parents in the past, and young people today are more decisive.	S_S1
In my own perspective, I think young people are more able to make decisions about their lives in today's society.	S_T0
Firstly, I think the advance in technology is an influencing factor.	S_M0
In the past, young people can only ask their parents for help when they have to make decisions about their life.	B_S0
This is because they think their parents know more than they do.	I_S0
But for now, the internet is popularized to most families.	I_S0
Young people can ask for some experts online if they are in a dilemma.	I_S0
Those experts could think more comprehensively than their parents do.	I_S0
For example, when I chose my middle school, I have to ask many people which high school is better in which aspect.	I_S0
Also, I could search for the information of every high school if they post it on the internet.	I_S0
I think it helps me a lot when I make my decisions.	E_S0
Secondly, there are more options for young people today, and it can practice their ability to making decisions.	S_M0
In my dad's time, there are only two ways for high school students, which are hard working for college and be a farmer after graduate.	B_S0
In today's society, opportunities are everywhere.	I_S0
People could choose which extra course they want when they first entry to elementary school.	I_S0
When I first entry to elementary school, I chose to learn badminton, whereas some of my friends chose to learn basketball.	I_S0
I think those decisions I made cultivate my decision-making skill.	E_S0
Admittedly, parents will teach their kids how to make decisions when their children ask them for help.	S_M0
I have known that some parents teach their son how to make decisions by comparing two choices in several different aspects.	B_S0
However, in my opinion, I think parents should let their kids learn by themselves.	I_S0
The ability cultivated by themselves is obiously more impressive than other teach them.	I_S0
Moreover, if parents help their children making decisions everytime they need, kids will consider this as a common thing.	I_S0
And the ability does not trained at all.	E_S0
All in all, I think p	S_S2
 
I think it is very necessary to offer school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.	S_T0
It will definetely benifit them a lot.	B_T1
First, it will give chileren an imply that if they study hard they will receive the reward and motived them to study hard to get this.	E_T1
There is no doubt that study is very boring and hard to keep on for most children.	B_S0
So if we give them some rewards, they will be motived and be more passionate for study,so they will study well and get good grade in the exam.	I_S0
And in this way they will receive more money and study harder.	E_S0
In the long term, this certainly will help chileren form a good studying habit and when there is no longer money,they can still konw how to study well.	S_T1
Second,by offer them  money,they will gratually konw how to handle with the money and learn the way of using money.	S_M2
They may save this money or shopping or eat outor anything else.	B_S0
It is his own choice,but it is their parents'money that  provide the choice.	I_S0
And they can do many things to deal with what they like.	I_S0
Many businessman start their own business when they are undergratuated,and they need money.	I_S0
Suppose that if they have saved a packet of money got from the high grade,they will be much more easier to start it and more quick to show thier talent in it.	E_S0
In all, I think it is necessary	S_S2
 
With the great development of the society, some people think they are less satisfied with their lives than people were in the past, while others may be very happy and regard the changes in the world as positive development.	B_T0
As for me, I agree with the latter idea, because nowadays lives are more convenient and colorful.	E_T0
First, the traffic is very convenient today.	S_M1
In cities, there are subways, buses, taxis which could help people going out.	B_S0
Out of cities, when people need to go on a trip or go to another city, they can take train, airplane or drive their own cars with a low price.	I_S0
It is obvious that in mordern society, the public traffic is effective and cheap.	I_S0
When my grandfather and grandmother went on trips, they felt it was so good that they could get to another place with is far in the city in just 10 minutes using subway.	I_S0
They thought it was great progress and felt satisfied.	E_S0
Second, with the development of Internet, it is easier to get information.	S_M1
People can know everything using the Internet, such as big events around the world, the lecture which professors in the famous universities gave and the traffic information at that time.	B_S0
In the past, newspaper contained information and it was slow.	I_S0
However, now information can be easily reached on the Internet and using computers or smartphones.	I_S0
Take my grandfather as an example, he likes reading news.	I_S0
In the past he could only use newspaper and broadcast to know what happened in the country.	I_S0
He said it was not convenient because he could not get information fast.	I_S0
But nowadyas it is really easy to get a lot of information in a short time.	E_S0
In fact, I could understand the people who think lives are less happy and less satisfying, because everyone is under pressure and lives are fast.	S_C2
These facts make people feel	O
 
Nowadays, many people consider it more important to finish working quickly and take risk of making mistakes.	S_I0
There are many reason why they highlight the significance of it: Finishing work earlier, they will not only have more time to do their own things but also be considered an efficient person by superior.	B_T0
However, in my opinion, it is more important to make sure everything is correct even if it is more slowly.	E_T0
First, the mistakes workers make sometimes upset the employers.	S_M2
As is known to all, employers eager to recriut careful and reliable employees.	B_S0
Handing in works without many mistake is more likely to entertain superiors even if workers use more time.	I_S0
And as a superior, seeing a wonderful work from inferior may sweeten the mood whole day.	I_S0
Beside, it is possible that the work the employers gave is really important.	I_S0
If making mistakes, workers may cause the superior to lose some opportunities and irritates them, which means they may not recieve important project to do anymore, or even will be dismissed.	E_S0
Furthermore, people will waste more time to correct their mistake later.	B_C0
If the kind superiors mark the mistake for them and let them modify, the workers will only correst the mistake without eagering to improve their work, and they will make the same mistakes next time, which may costs them more time to modify in turn.	I_C0
If the employer ask them to modify without pointing faults, much more time will be wasted because people can hardly find mistakes in their own work on their own.	E_C0
And the revised work probably has many other place wrong and fails to satisfy the employer, which takes the worker additional time.	S_S2
 
I agree the follwing statement that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.	B_S0
Here is my reason: Firstly, When someone needs to relax, in some points, he or she was in a very tried situation.	I_S0
So in these time, if let he or she to do more physical exercise, it will make him or she more tried.	I_S0
It's very incorrect.	I_S0
Second, When a person watching a movie or reading a book, It will let he or she in a different space in his or her real life, and he or she can saw the different views in others life, so it will give people new views about his or her real life and help people to solve the problems in fresh points.	I_S0
and the last, watching a movie or reading a book is easily to let person to calm down and have a good attitude to all things.	I_S0
So these way I was mentioned, is a better way to relax a person than doing physical exercise.	I_S0
It doesn't say do physical exercise is not good for us, of course, physical exercise will keep us in a healthy body, and only we have a health bosy, then we can do anyting others we want to do.	I_S0
But this really is not a good way when people want to have relax, sometime when we finished physical exercise, we will feel more tied and more excited.	E_S0
So here is my advice, when you want to relax yourself, go to watching a movie or reading a book, it is better than doing physical exrcise in that time.	S_M2
and then we can doing physical exercise in other time, such as in the morning of the day or the night of day.	B_S1
It's a more wisly choice.	E_S1
 
Nowadays, the problem of education has arisen more and more attention of public.	B_S0
Since parents consider education much more seriously, they are likely to creat some effective methods to encourage their children to study autonomously.	I_S0
Recently, the question regarding whether parents should offer their school-age children money for high marks can be controversial.	I_S0
Thinking this issue, different people hold different opinions.	I_S0
While some people claims that it will change children's attitude on study, which means that money may become the purpose of learning, however, I still contend that offering some money to children as a reward is a practicable strategy to stir up the independence of children's study.	E_S0
To start with, there is no doubt that giving money to children as a reward will stimulate them to study harder.	S_M2
Reading passages, working on math problems and writing, we cannot refute that studying is definitely boring and many children are forced to work hard.	B_S1
But when children get feedback of their hard work, the sense of accomplishment will make their study become a happy job instead of tired duty.	E_S1
That is to say, money is like a final goal	O
 
Despite the rapid development of today's society, parenthood is no more than a commonplace.	B_I0
Recently, an interesting question has aroused heated discussion: Is playing sports better than doing schoolwork together when parents only have a little time with children?	I_I0
Different people has differental views.	I_I0
Some people prefer to doing sports.	I_I0
However, others keep the opposite thought.	I_I0
From my perspective, I think having fun playing sports is better.	E_I0
My reasons are as follows.	S_T0
To begin with, having fun playing games and sports is beneficial to children's physical condition.	S_M0
Generally speaking, busy parents are likely to ignore the health condition of children, which is a fundamental element for personal development.	B_S0
When playing sports together, parents can know the physical condition and be aware of health problem of children like maldevelopment of bones and decline in eyesight which can be exposed in children's performance.	I_S0
For example, my nighbors always paly sports with their son at weekend because their are busy with work tasks and seldom have enough time with the child.	I_S0
However, their child has a perfect body condition with little attention from parents in weekdays because the health problems are found in playing soprts and then solved in an early period.	E_S0
On top of that, the relationship in family are firmed in a relaxing atomosphere during the process of having fun.	S_M0
Children are likey to relax when playing games and sports, which leads to more communication with parents.	B_S0
Interesting things in school, their recent condition and the issues that bother them are prone to be told to parents.	I_S0
Gradually, parents know more about their children even they only have a little time with their kinds.	I_S0
As a result, the relastionship between kids and parents becomes more solid.	I_S0
On the contrary, kids are always stressed when the statement comes to the issues of schoolwork, which causes a nervous condition.	I_S0
In this case, children do not want to talk about their recent condition of study and life, which is not good for their parent to know more about them.	E_S0
Admittedly, doing things related to schoolwork has some advantages like parents can know children's study condition.	S_M0
In the process of doing schoolwork together, parents have a view on their kids' study.	B_S0
However, when bing compared with the two elements above, it is a minor factor.	I_S0
Without having fun and playing sports together with the kids.	I_S0
parents cannot improve children's health condition and firm the relationship in family.	E_S0
To put it into a nutshell, I totally agree with the statement that playing games or sports is more important when parents have little time with kids.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, there is a heated topic aroused among people: whether it is better for team parters to do a project by face-to-face.	B_I0
Opinions differ from people to people.	E_I0
Some people think that group members should communicate through emails to finish a project.	B_T0
However, on the contrary to their opinion, I think communicating in person is a better choice.	E_T0
To begin with, face-to-face discuss can help the project finish efficiently.	S_M2
It is acknowledged that if the colleagues communicate in person, they can supervise each other, which help all group members keep in the same pace.	B_S0
In this case, they can finish the work quilkly and efficiently.	I_S0
Take myself as an example, I took part in a study group with 5 classmates to do a biological project.	I_S0
Some of the team member are lazy and unfamiliar with the topic theme, so it is hard for them to solve their part of project in time without our supervisor.	I_S0
In this case, during the whole time, we do the project together in the library, and then they were encourged by other team members and never be lazy, thus we finished the project effiently.	I_S0
By contrast, if group members discuss on the internet by emails, it is impratical to detect all members process, thus some members who are lazy or who have problems with the projects can not achieve it in time, which will lead the whole project can not finished efficiently.	E_S0
Moreover, communicating in person can ensure the good effort of the project.	B_C1
It is because group members can fully present their capabitities and needs, then there will be a professional and effective diversion among all the team members.	E_C1
In this case,  all team members deal with the things which they are suitable and interest in, so they will make a good effort of the project.	S_S2
However, if people discuss on the email, they would not express their needs clearly, so they can not achi	O
 
The development of a city needs the government's help.	S_I0
But whether the governments should pay more attention on the Internet access or the public transportation is debatable.	S_T1
Some people think that the governments should mainly focus on the Internet access because ehis term really needs the government's support while other people believe that the governmmentw' should spend more money on public transportation because that is really something that benefit to most of the citizens.	S_T0
However, I strongly advocate the latter, here are the reasons.	S_T1
First of all, the problem of heavy traffic jam is grievous, which is more important for the governments to solve.	S_M1
Nowadays, the population of the world is increasing which result that there are more cars on the road.	B_S0
The more cars, the more serious the traffic jam.	I_S0
Like in China, most people needs at least 40 minutes to get to work.	I_S0
The time that spent on the traffic is pretty long but just useless.	I_S0
As a result, time that could spent on the work wastes on the traffic.	I_S0
It is really a pity and let people less effective.	I_S0
Also, the terrible transportation of the city will also make the cilizens less satisfy with the governments.	I_S0
However, the Internet access now is not in that hurry and is less important than the daily transportation.	I_S0
Therefore, the government really should spend more money on the more terrilble transportaton.	E_S0
Indeed, the number of cyber citizen is increasing, and the need is of thirst.	S_M1
However, compared with dailt transportation, the Internet access is not that significant.	B_S0
We can live without the Internet, however, we cannot live with out the basic transportation.	I_S0
We can bear the lack of Internet equipment, but we cannot stand the bad system of the transportation.	I_S0
Thus, the governments should pay more attention to the more important part of life---transportation.	E_S0
All in all, it is less crucial for governments to spend money to upgrade the Internet access than to improve the pubic transportation.	S_C2
 
Since almost every individual has a tight schedule in mondern sociaty which means they spend a little time on relaxing, the approaches of relaxing are extensively discussed.	B_I0
Some people contend that sedentary quiet methods, like watching a moive and reading a book, are better.	I_I0
Nevertheless, some holds an opposing view.	E_I0
They prefer to relax by doing exercise.	B_T0
As for me, I am not in favor of the statement.	E_T0
I firmly believe that physical exercise is the best way to relax.	B_S1
My opinion will be explained by analyzing the following reasons.	E_S1
First and foremost,  physical exercise is conducive to mantaining our health, which is also the purpose of relaxation.	S_M0
When we do exercises, we always breath in high frequency, absorbing more oxygion and getting the carbondoxide out of our body.	B_S0
Activities will decrease our possibilities to get flu and strenghthen our immense system.	I_S0
For instance, my dad, who runs 20 minutes everyday, didn't have an ill last year.	I_S0
For this reason, physical exercise is a valuble way to relax.	E_S0
On top of that, we can extend our social intership when we participate in team activities like basketball and football.	S_M0
Meeting new people and having some topics with them provide us an excellent to relax in that they help you smooth your mind.	B_S0
Take me for an example, when I am frustrated because of the tough project, I will feel better after talking to my basketball team member.	I_S0
Therefore, we can be relaxed when doing exercise.	E_S0
It is true that watching a movie alone and reading an attractive book quietly are useful ways to get relaxed, too.	S_M0
Nonetheless, we have spare a large amount of our time sitting on the chair and before the desk.	B_S1
So why don't we stand up and walk out, taking some fresh air and enjoying the warm sunshine?	E_S1
To put it into nutshell, physical exercise relax both our body and mind.	B_C0
At the same time, we befriend interesting people that we may never meet before.	I_C0
For the above reasons, I strongly insist that physical exercise is the most effective and the best way to relax.	E_C0
 
I think if workers have different kinds of tasks, they will easier to have satisfaction.	S_T1
Different types of tesks may make people pay more attention on the work.	B_S0
For example, when I was in high school, I have many kinds of subjects like mathematics, English and P.E.	I_S0
In the morning when I finished two math classes I will feel bored and tired, may be want to sleep.	I_S0
At that time I have a P.E class.	I_S0
I can go out of the classroom to get sun shine and fresh air.	I_S0
My classmates and I are running, jumping in the P.E class to relaxed ourselves.	I_S0
Even we can speand a little time to buy some foods or drind after we do the sports exercise and set down under the tree to talk for free.	I_S0
When we finished P.E class we have to have a English class which I don't like.	I_S0
But during the P.E class, I feel I' m better then before, I can study more carefully and do my homework more quickly.	I_S0
But, on the weekends, I have too many after school classes.	I_S0
I should have a math class for 4 houres.	I_S0
Everytime after my math class, I even don't know what the teacher say in the class.	I_S0
And when I get home I think that I not only didn't learn anything but also can't do the homewoke as well as when I in the school.	I_S0
So, it is useful for me to have different kinds of work.	E_S0
 
I don't think this is a good idea.	B_I0
Nowadays the education of teenagers is really of great importance than ever before.	I_I0
So many parents may use a lot of ways to stimulate their children to study to get higher grades.	I_I0
Some may give their children much money to their high grades.	I_I0
This phenomenon has successfully cause national concern these days.	I_I0
Different people have different ideas towards this problem.	E_I0
However, when the problem comes to me, I am totally against the way to give money to children to help them study.	S_T1
To begin with, giving money to children may make our children have the feeling that they are syuding for money but not for learning knowleges and themselves.	S_M1
So once parents stop to give them money for the prides of their grades, they will feel much disappointed and very upset and therefore reject to studying hard again.	B_S0
This is a also a very serious problem.	I_S0
Because once children study for get more money, they burry themselves into the ocean of knowlege and they won't feel the pleasure from study.	I_S0
As far as I am concerned, if parents let their children study for money, they will also waste a lot of money which can be used to help their children to learn several usefull life skills or buy some interesting books to broaden their kid's horizons.	E_S0
Besids that, there is another reason of me to oppose the way.	S_M1
You know that it is very   important to cultivate children's creativity.	B_S0
However, if parents offer them money for high grade they get in school, their creativity's development might be disturbded because children won't study hard or think hard or do some research or experiment on some difficult problems.	I_S0
They only study to get much money.	I_S0
What's more, to get more money from their parents , they may copy and cheat during the examination, which is also not good for their character's development.	E_S0
Concluded from what I have mentioned above, I am definitely against the phenomenon that parents give their children money as a reward for getting high scores in school.	S_C2
 
Recently, many people think that it is better to relax by watching a movi or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.	B_T0
In my opinion, I disagree with this statement for some reasons.	E_T0
First, doing physical could not only help us to relax ,but also help us to become healthier and develop the habit of exercising.	S_M0
When we are tired of working or studying, we could do some exercise like running, riding bike ,playing basketball or so on.	B_S0
We can choose one of the sports that we like best and enjoy the most, so we will have fun when doing the sprt.	I_S0
After we finish doing the sports, we will feel satisfied and enjoyful that means we can go back to work as  better selves.	E_S0
Second, as we all know ,many students enjoy playing computer games to relax in their free time ,playing cpmputer games is harmful to their eyes and a waste of time.	S_M0
Doing physical exercise can help students to forget playing computer games, and when students want to do some physical exercise which require group working like basketball, football and badminton, they may ask their friends to paly with them, so the friendship between the students may become harder and they may make more friends during playing sports.	S_S2
Third,watching a movie or reading a book is not a good way to relax because the stories may be so interesting and exciting ,that the people can not help watching or reading ,it may cause people forget to get back to work or study.	S_M0
People may also keep thinking about the stories in the books or in the movies ,so thay may not focus on their work, and this will make them become less efficiency.	B_S1
Watching a movie and reading a book also means that the people may just sitting without moving in a long period of time which are bad for their health.	E_S1
Those are the reasons why I think it is better to relax by doing physical exercise than watching a movie or readinga book.	S_C2
 
Recent years our society has undergone tremendous changes, the publics pay more attention on children's education, an intriguing discussion has arisen among people: whether students should be given more time to do things they like instead of doing homework or organizing school activities.	B_I0
Answers vary from one one person to another.	E_I0
The way I see it, it is crucial to give children more time to do what ever they want, my reasons and examples are given below.	S_T0
First, more spare time can help student boost study efficiency.	S_M0
Nowadays, students are under increasing heave pressure, the assignments and school activities take up most of their time, causing they feel exhausted and stressed out.	B_S0
If schools give them more time, they can listen to music, watch a fantistic movie, play games outside with their friends and do other things they want.	I_S0
It can help them release their stess and study more efficiently.	I_S0
As far as I am concerned.	I_S0
I usually spend time listening my favorite songs by Oasis to have a break during study, the melody can help me relax and more concentrated when continue studying.	E_S0
Inaddition, children can be freinds with more people if they have more time.	S_M0
If school require students to finish much homework and organize much campus activities, they have to be busy in school and quikly go home to do their homewoek, having no chance to communicate with others.	B_S0
If they can have more time, they can travel or take part in some activities outside school, exposing them to new environment and giving them more chance to meet new people and make friends with them.	I_S0
I remember that I met my best friend Mary during my trip to Sichuan province, it leave us  unforgetable memory.	E_S0
Granted, doing homework can help students absorb more knowledge and do good to their study, which is important to all of them.	S_M0
While more spare time can give them more freedom to do other meaningful things they want, it is conducive to help them become versatile.	B_S1
Overall development is more indispansable for children.	E_S1
To put in a nut shell, I contends children should have more time to do what they want, because it can enhance their study efficeincy and help them make more friends, which is beneficial to their all arounded development.	S_C2
 
Recent decades have witnessed an obvious trend that people's living levels are becoming better and better.	B_I0
Because of that, children's begin to get more money from their parents.	E_I0
Many parents choose give much money which is equal with children's grade.	S_T1
In my opinion, I don't support with this way to give money to children.	S_T0
It is undeniable that it can helps to improve their activities for studing.	S_M2
However, the negative effects induced by the greed for money should not be ignored.	B_S0
When I was a senior high school students, I had a classmate who had not good grades.	I_S0
She wanted some money to buy something about her hobbies, but her father told her that she should get good grade, then he would give her money.	I_S0
So she began study hard to gain better grade.	I_S0
Unfortunately, she hadn't enough determination to persist in hard-working.	I_S0
But she also wanted to get money, so she chose to use a terrible way to gain her fathers aim, cheating.	I_S0
The first time she had got a great grade, her father gave her a number of money, then she began to cheat in every examination.	I_S0
Finally, in the final exam, she couldn't copy others answer, even she could be enrolled by any university.	E_S0
I think the activity about studing need using more positive way to increase, money or interest exert an adverse impact on children's minds and values.	B_C0
The more profits be used to entice children, the worse values and the more greed will influence them.	I_C0
So as for me, I think equate money with grade is not a good idea.	E_C0
 
Nowdays, with the commntinuous developent of society, people get rich than before, which enable them to try to new things , especially travelingto place that they have not been to before.	S_I0
Some people think traveling to foreign country is better than traveling to foreign counties, while others believe that traveling to foreign countries is better.	B_T0
As forme, l strongly agree the later one, and mt reason will be analyed in the following paragraphs.	E_T0
First off all, traveling to foreign countries provides people opportunity to open up their eye.	S_M1
When visiting a frreign country, what traveler usually do may be visiting museum, paying a visit to historycal site and communicate with local people.	B_S0
Through these experimeces, they can get to know more about other countrydissimilar culture, customand history of that country.	I_S0
By contrast, when traveling in traveler own country, althougnthey may visit museum famous site as well, they could not learn somethings new because they share the same culture custom and historywith the resident who live in the place that they visit.	I_S0
For example, my firend went to Spain last year.	I_S0
On the first day of her trip, she went to a restaurant at 7;00pm, which is the time when our Chinese have dinner.	I_S0
Surprisingly, she found that restaurant was almost empty.	I_S0
When she almost finished the dinner at about 9;00, local people began to enter the restaurant in large numbers.	I_S0
It was them she realized that Spainsh people enjoy their dinner quite late.	I_S0
The example illustarte that by visiting foreign countries, people can broaden their horizon.	E_S0
Second, traveling to foreogn countries can improve our language skill, whuch will be of great help tp our future work.	S_M1
During the process of trveling in a foreign country, the travelers usually pushednto coomunicate with local people in foreign language.	B_S0
Things, such as asking direnction, ordering food and going to shopping are what happen constantly almost everday when one is in a foreign country and rather helpful for travelers in practising foreign language.	I_S0
Furthermore, the the language skill aquired in the process of visiting a foreign country can help one gainmre job opportunities.	E_S0
Du to the rapid progression of globalizaton, it is uncommon that employye may encounter foreign customer	O
 
I really disagee with the statement, because I think education qualities can not be measured by the salaries of university professors.	B_T0
What we should do is to change our mind to become more devoted and responsible.	E_T0
The specific reasons are given below.	S_T1
Firstly, in order to enhence the quality of education, the professors should make some changes but not the universities.	S_M1
Because moeny does not have the abity to buy everything seprcially some abstract things like education.	B_S0
Hence, why not to advocate the professors to pay more efforts to help their students.	I_S0
We must know that we can not try to solve everything by money.	I_S0
How about using our mind to think out more useful solutions.	I_S0
For examples, when I was a little kid, I had already konwn how to use money.	I_S0
Because of this, I always told others I am a rich girl and I can solve every problems by money.	I_S0
With the time went by, my friends became less and less.	I_S0
I felt really sad.	I_S0
Accidentally, I heard that they all thought I am a ueseless gril.	I_S0
Gradually, I realized my shortage.	I_S0
I began to solve my troubles by thinking but not money.	I_S0
Since then, I know that we can not depend on money.	E_S0
Secondly, who should to make changes is the students like me.	S_M1
We could not always depend on our teachers to help us improve our education.	B_S0
We must bury ourselves in studying hard.	I_S0
We can try to do something to increase our study efficiency.	I_S0
In my opinion, I suggest that we can make some plans before we doing something.	I_S0
As a result og this, we can finish our homework both quickly and in good qualities.	I_S0
So why not try to do it.	I_S0
What I want to say is that we must be a independent people to find our own problems oduring the study.	I_S0
If we do this by ourselves, we can find appropriate solutions to solve in a short time.	I_S0
And making a change of our study right away.	I_S0
Only the most adapt solution is the best one.	I_S0
Everyone is unique, we are familiar with ourselves most.	I_S0
Hence, in order to hence the eduation students should mak e a change.	E_S0
All in all, professors and students are the people who should make a change, but not the universities.	B_C0
Whatever how much the universities change, the qualities of the education will not be enhenced.	I_C0
Thus, I think the statement is actaully not correct.	I_C0
Because I think universities are the place can give us  comfortable places to study hard.	I_C0
The most essential people are the professors and students of the college.	E_C0
 
I don't agree with that.	B_T0
Through the young people today may not have a lot of experience or do not have a deep studay of a subject.	I_T0
They do have a lot of addvantage that can make a great contrubution to an important decisions that determine the future of the society.	E_T0
For a start, the youth is the people who can accept the new technology or the new ideas most quickly.	S_M0
The modern society is developing very fast, As a reprot, the knowledge will renew in erery four years.	B_S0
So the new technology or the new methood is becoming more and more improtant in the process of dealing with the society's problems.	I_S0
And the youth can understand the these technology and methood more quickly and more welling to use these.	I_S0
So they can through it to influent the important decisions.	E_S0
In addition, the youth is more excited and more willing to try or to do.	S_M0
The inprotant decisions are all relevent with a lot of people future, so some time it is very hard to make a decision, espicially for the olders, they may fell so pressured.	B_S0
But the youth will can make such an hard decision.	I_S0
They don't afread of the field, they have a lot of time to persuit the succeed.	I_S0
so the often use the ther brave to influence the important decisions.	E_S0
Last, the youth are the future maker.	S_M0
they are young, have a lot of time, and the future is truly be made from their hand.	B_S1
They ofcouse, have right to decise the future, to influent the important decisions.	E_S1
The youth can throuth the new technology and new methood to influent the important decisions, and they are brave to make the important decisions, and they have right to decise their future.	B_C1
So I think they have Influence on the important decisions.	E_C1
 
these days,with the prevailing of the internet, the computer has conquered the lives of all human beings, people work on it, students study with it, even children begin to play games on it instead of doing outdoor activities.	B_I0
therefore, the issue of whether students should be allowed to play computer games gained much debate.	I_I0
some people think it is a waste of  time.	E_I0
and this opinion also goes to me.	S_T0
first and foremost, playing computer games will harm children's eyes seriously.	S_M1
after the hard work of thier school study, children's eye have undertaken much pressure.	B_S0
and if we still allow the children to play the computer games on the computher or mobile phone, this is defetidely a deeper hurt on their eyes.	I_S0
there is no way to let them feel relax on physical.	I_S0
like my niece, after playing a game called dota for year duringhis leisuretime, he cant see things in distance without glasses,aslo he get fatter and fatter owning to his lackness in sports.	E_S0
secondly, children are really get indulged in the computer games  easily, so they will think about the games all the time even if they are studying in the classroom.	S_M1
this will causing their time during the classroom becoming useless.	B_S0
for example, jake who is a second grade students, he always talks about the plots ang stategy in the camputer games during the 10 mins break during the school time.	I_S0
but 10 mins is not always enough to express himself, so he began to send messages on the phone with his so-called paterners to go on the talk during the classtime.	I_S0
so this is a definete ly waste of time, he learned nothing in claaromm, ang go on playing the games after the class.	E_S0
nevertheless, i admit that some kinds of games are really delicated in pictures, and the plot of the story is really amazing, all of these factors can only show it is a good way to kill time, but not a good excuse for children to play the computer games, because thier eyes will be harmed and time will get wasted.	S_C2
 
When it comes to the issue whether young people depended more on their parents to make decisions inthe past than they are today, perspectives vary from person to person.	S_I0
Some people believes that it is not true because nowadays young people are face more temptations.	B_T0
Nevertheless, as far as I am concerned, young people today are better able to mack decisions by themselves.	E_T0
To begin with, young people nowadays face a large number of informations which enrich their mind and become a part of their experience so they are easily to make decisions than before.	S_M1
For example, people in the past decided their major course mainly from their parents since they don't know each major well and the most reasonable suggests were from their parents.	B_S0
However, young people can easily obtain professional informations by searching on the internet.	I_S0
These informations help them make dicisions.	E_S0
In addition, parents in the moderm society are likely to give the priority to their children.	S_M1
In the past, parents wanted to make dicisions for their children because of hoping their chilren develop as they imagined even in their marriage	S_S2
In a nutshell, from what have been mentioned above, in recent days young people have more freedom to make dicisions than they are in the past.	S_C2
 
Some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grades(mark) they get in school.	B_I0
To this issue, different people come up with various attitude.	E_I0
As far as I am concerned, I am inclined to be disapproved of this action.	S_T0
From my perspective, parents consider the money as a motivation----the higher grade you get, the more money you will receive.	S_M1
Children are likely to study harder and get a higher grade in order to get more money.	B_S0
Maybe by this way can have some positive effects on improving the children's grades, nevertheless, it stands for a improper concept of value.	I_S0
To describe it more pricisely, it conveys a concept that children study hard for the sake of money instead of puisuiting the knowledge.	E_S0
The human race has entered a completely new stage in its history, with the increasingly rapid economic growth, it is undeliable that we put the empasis on money, and try to solve problems with money or else more money.	S_M1
This will lead the children to a wrong direction.	B_S0
They will consider money is everything's goal, and the true meaning of study will disappear.	I_S0
We must realize the core of stusy is to make ourselves a better man.	E_S0
To draw a conclusion, I am not support the behavior.	S_C2
To encourage children to study hard, parents should use other methods to truly est their interest.	S_S2
 
I think that getting relaxed by watching a movie or reading a book is better than by doing physical exercise.	S_T0
We all have time when we feel so tired or anxious or neverous and that is when we need to get relaxed.	S_T1
We need other things to catch our attentions , to relife us , to help us have better conditions.	S_T0
From my perspective, I will choose watching a moive or reading a book instead of doing physical exersice.	S_T1
First we have to understand what a movie or a book can bring to us.	S_M1
Through reading we can know others' lives,for exampel,in romantic stories, we can experience love stories,in science frictions,we can get knowledge totally different from what we get in daily life.	B_S1
Also in movies such as "Harry Potter",we can drop ourselves into imagination and forget about the issues that bother us in work or in school.	E_S1
Then we need to kown of course exercise is good to us however,it will make us exhausted and sleepy.	S_M1
Also doing sports has requirment on time.	B_S0
Suppose that you want to get relaxed in the midnight,will you go out to jog？	I_S0
But you can read or have a movie at anytime.	E_S0
It depends on whether you like being quite or being active.	B_C1
As for me,movie or friction does better job!	E_C1
 
The biggest problem between parents and their school-age children is the children's grades.	B_I0
Parents often feel mad or unhappy about their kids' bad grade.	I_I0
So the solution for this situation is when the children got a high grade, parents offer them money.	E_I0
I don't support this idea, because this will have a lot of negative effects on children's world view, confidence and relationship.	S_T0
First, children's world view can have an extreme wanting on money and studies.	S_M0
When high grades and money has an equal sign.	B_S0
Children could think if I am good at studying then I can get money.	I_S0
Two bad circumstances could happen.	I_S0
The first one is the child only focus in study and doesn't socialize at all.	I_S0
After this child grow up, the child could be bullied or doesn't even get a job.	I_S0
The second on is the child thinks money and study is everything he or she needs.	I_S0
So when the child grow up, he or she would realize parents' opinion weren't right at all.	I_S0
Since they didn't get enough practice on socailzing, it will be hard for them to get money in the society.	I_S0
So don't let your child thinks money and grades are everything.	E_S0
Second, the child's confidence could be strongly distroied.	S_M0
If the child is not good at studies amd often get C or Ds.	B_S0
Then they will not get money from their parents.	I_S0
There is a great chance that the child would think that his or hers parents don't love or dislike he or she.	I_S0
So the child's confidence would be less and less.	I_S0
So don't just give them money for a high grade.	E_S0
Third, the child counld dislike the parents.	S_M0
When the situation in paragragh 2 happened, if the parents didn't notice this.	B_S0
Then the confidence of the child would go down to the lowest point.	I_S0
So the relationship between the child and the parents would be weak.	I_S0
So don't let this happen.	E_S0
In conclusion, give chidren money for each high grade is not doable and could influerence children in many bad ways.	B_C1
The parents would not want their children and their relationships to end up in a each bad condition.	E_C1
 
Nowadays, many student's parents praise their children for their high mark in schoolwork with money.	S_I0
Altough it can promote students to study harder to get higher scroes, I don't convict that it's a good way.	S_T1
First, doing like this may mislead the student that thier study purpose is for money rather than gaining knowlege.	S_M1
Therefore it's not good for fostering their interest of learning so that they may not have dynamic hope to do further study and it's bad for the development of learning creativity and independent.	B_S1
So once they can't get money, they may get bored with learning quickly.	E_S1
Second, offering money will indicate the chilren that the importance of money.	S_M1
It has a negective impact on education of student.	B_S0
They may gradually use money to measure things or people.	I_S0
They will pay attention to the diffrence between the rich and poor.	I_S0
But we are supposed to do like this.	I_S0
So it has bad influence on fair and respected environment of society.	E_S0
To conclude, money is not always uesful and beneficial to us, especially on study activity.	B_C1
We should value the students' will to study harder from their heart.	E_C1
 
nowadays, a controversial topic aroused around a heated debate among people: whether they should follow their ambitious dreams or focus on achieving realistic goals.	S_T1
Opinions vary from person to person.	S_T0
Some people contends that people should purchase their original dream, even though it might be ambitious.	S_T1
On the contrary, I hold the opposite view that people should focus on achieving realistic goals.	S_T0
First, it is easer for people to achieve their dream if they focus on some achievable dream.	S_M1
people with a achievable dream will be encouraged by their goals because they thought they can achieve it if they try out to do it.	B_S0
On the contrary, if someone focus on a ambitious dream, he may choose to give up if he has struggled for many years without any achievement.	I_S0
For example, My father asked me what is my dream school when I was a child.	I_S0
I told him that I want to go to TsingHua University, which is the best institution in China.	I_S0
My father told me that if I set a too ambitious dream, you may forget what you should do now.	I_S0
So , he sugget that I can focus on entering Wuhan No.1 Middle School, the best middle school in my city, and then, try to study hard to get a high score on University Entering Test.	I_S0
I followd my father's suggest that focus on a achieving realistic goals and finally enter the TsingHua University.	E_S0
Furthermore, people who focus on the achieving realistic goals will be more health than others.	S_M1
People who want to achieve their ambitious dream have to work hard for it.	B_S0
In that case, they have to study or work longer than others and may work until the midnight, which is obviously bad for their health.	I_S0
Moreover, if they did not achieve their dream, they might be upset or even have the suicide tendency.	I_S0
Imagine a man dreams to be the best singer around the world.	I_S0
He practise the singing technic all days and sometimes keep singing for twenty hours, his must be tired and easy to get sick.	I_S0
And if he did not achieve it, he may get some mental disease.	E_S0
 
I agree with the statement that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information.	B_I0
Firstly,the internet is super efficient and conveninet.	I_I0
As a student,when i encounter with hard problems while studying,i turn to the internet for help.	E_I0
The information from the internet always give me hand.	S_T1
Secondly,if we use the internet in a proper way,we can broaden our horizon by going throught the benefical information.	S_M1
We can also aprreciate the view of the world through internet information if we do not have enought time or money to spend.	S_S2
Thirdly,when we do shopping,we can test whether we really need such things from reading the investation offer by internet information,which would be helpful for our shopping.	S_M1
also,the online shop such asTaobao,Amazon,Ebay,and you name it.	B_S1
There is millions of information provided by shopper.	E_S1
The last but not least,in today's financial and economy area,the big-data will plays an essencial roal to help people with difficult statistics and analysis,which willbe a big time-saving.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, the competitions between people become more and more intense.	B_I0
We may have a lot of pressure in all ways.	I_I0
The importance of releasing the pressure can never be exaggerated.	I_I0
The majority hold the point that watching a movie or reading a book can really relax ourselves in emotional ways while other stands in the opposite.	E_I0
However, I will show my apperciation to the standpoint that physical exercise is an unsurpassed choice for us and our bodies.	S_T0
It is well-penetrating to conclude that physicial exrcise can go a long way to our physical and emotional outlet.	S_M1
We relive and alleviate the burden we took after taking some exercises more often.	B_S0
For example, hiking and running make us an access to sweating and embracing the fresh air and serene sky with the aim to become more vigorous and efficient.	I_S0
While we are swimming in the pool, we are capable of immersing into cool water, claming the nerves and restoring the souls whenever we are disturbed by various puzzles or obstacles.	E_S0
It is well-insightful to envinsion that physical exercise never lack paramount benefits to our well-being.	S_M1
Soundness coming from exercises also paves the major way for us to have higher efficiency in ulterior work and study.	B_S0
It is not rare to see that currently there are increasing number of people from all ages, especially students and white colors who spend most of their time sitting in frount of the desk, enter the fitness center so as to take sports.	I_S0
Proper physicial exercises can effectively prevent them from many horrifies and terrible disease and illness derived from improper working or life habits, like cervial spondy lopathy and insomnia, eventually help them to achieve good health so as to maintain high concentration on their works and full energy in lives while simple books and movies fail to provide.	E_S0
To put it into a nutshell, reading books or watching movies are not as suitable and effective as the physical exercises.	B_C1
Doing physical exercises not only gurantee us in a good health condition, but provide us a way to lighten our burden.	E_C1
 
In modern society's high-paced life, people are easy to feel tired because of long time work or study, what can we do to relax ourself?	B_I0
By watching a movie or reading a book ?	I_I0
Or by doing physical exercise?	E_I0
I prefer the first one.	S_T0
There are several reasons for that.	S_S2
First, movies and books are easier to make you calm down, while doing physical exercise can not.	S_M0
When you watch a movie or reading a book you may feel as if you are in that situation and you are experience the same thing as the writer describes.	B_S1
But if you do physical exercise, you may just feel tired and exhausted, there are no other things it can help.	E_S1
Second, watching a movie or reading a book you needn't move, you can just rest on a sofa and then enjoy yourself,  use your favirote posture, sit, lie, inside home or outside your house, it is good for people who are lazy and not willing to move at all and you have many options.	S_M0
Physical exercise need lots of energies to finish and you should keep exercising and moving, what is more, you need to go out to exercise, so you don't have many selections.	S_S2
Third, lots of funny movies and books are very intersting and will make laugh after daily work, touching movies or books can make you know stories about characters and you are possible to affect by their love stories or stories of friendships.	S_M0
What is more, watching movies and reading books is beneficial to learn different kind of knowledges you may never know before, they can help you to broaden your horizon and inform of many interesting things.	B_S1
While doing phisical exercise can not.	E_S1
So, as far as i am concerned, it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise, and it has much more advantages.	S_C2
 
Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among students:people have to follow their dreams or set realistic goals for themselves.	B_I0
Opiniion vary from person to person.	E_I0
Some claim that people should follow their dreams even if the dreams even if the dreams are ambitious.	B_T0
However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that people have to accomplish the actual goal first.	I_T0
My point can be elaborated as follows.	E_T0
First of all, achieving a realistic goal can boost our confidence.	S_M1
To be more specific, practial goals are always easy to achieve, so when we accomplish one small goal after another, we will feel confident in our life.	B_S0
On the contrary, if we work hard at first with our dreams as goals, we may give up because it is too difficult and lose confidence in our lives.	I_S0
In the end nothing could be done.	I_S0
For example, I had been a scientist since i was a child, so i took this as my goal, but as i got older and older, i felt that my goal was getting harder to achieve, so finally i had to give up, and i did nothing.	E_S0
Secondly, achieving small goals can attrat more people help you.	S_M1
To be more specific, when you focus on achieving realistic goals, you will attrat more people come to see your experience, so may be they will help you to achieve your goals, because small goals are easy to finish.	B_S0
On the contrary, if you make your dream to be a goal, you will lose the people that want to help you, because they may think your goal is too difficult to achieve, so you will feel more difficult to realize your dreams because no one will help you.	I_S0
For example, when i was young, i make a goal that i want to be a scientist,	E_S0
 
Nowadays more and more people aware of  successing in job which is very important.	S_I0
then there comes a controversy that the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school which one is more important.	B_T0
In my opinion, i believe that studying hard in school is more important because successing in job is basen on studying hard.	E_T0
To begain with, studying hard can bring us knowledge about we can use in our job in the future.	S_M1
In the school, we can get lots of useful knowledge which is essentiasl in our job and if you have not these knowlegde, the company would not give you offer.	B_S0
For example, i have a friend who is learning chemistry but he usually play computer game in the university and never go to the class which means that at the end of exam his grade is under standtard.	I_S0
when he graduate from university, he even cannot find a good job.	I_S0
because his grade is too bad to accomplish the assignment  which is his boss give him so i maintains that studying hard is more important .	E_S0
Additionly, Studying hard also can help you to form comprehensive ability which is benefical for your job in the future.	S_M1
in the school, you must particpate acadimic group which means that you have to communicate with others and do some experimental with your classmates so that you can get the ability of conmmunication and cooperation.	B_S0
For instance, in a  group you will finish homework which is assign by teacher with your classmate and you think your view is right so that you must talk abot what you think which is good way to practice you abililty.	I_S0
Studying hard also can help us to get comprehensive ability which will help us success in the job in the future.	E_S0
However, the ability to relate well to people is also important about our job and we can get more help from our pattern.	S_C2

Have you ever watch some political issue on TV?	B_I0
nowadays, with the develpoment of the internet, most of the people have access to know about the political events, and they will put their own point of view, then comment it everwhere.	E_I0
However, I still consider that teacher should not maek their social view know to students in the classroom, they should not mention the political events in school.	S_T0
To begin with, teacher who comment political events in school may make children distraction.	S_M1
In fact, students should put most of their time on study in order to get high grade.	B_S0
And the political views from teacher is irrelevant form the study.	I_S0
Iamgine that, if teacher spend too much time on provide his or her own attitude toward somme social issue, there will be less time for the teacher to teach the knowledge which students should master.	I_S0
However, the knowledge is the most important thing students should learn in the school.	E_S0
On the top of that, as students don't have their own judgement about the polotical events.	S_M1
It means if teacher provides with his or her own prospective toward social or political events, students will hold the same view without consideration for they believe in their teacher.	B_S0
However, teacher's view maybe wrong.	I_S0
For instance, some teacher may says that the people who are living in indian are poor.	I_S0
However, the teacher even don't know much about the indian, he don't know about the development of indian.	I_S0
Neverthless, students will hold the same view though the view is wrong.	I_S0
In brief, teacher's own view maybe wrong and it may influence the view of his students.	E_S0
In addition, though let students teach with the polical or social events is good for their future development, and cultivate their ability about consideration.	S_C2
However, some of the view	O
 
When it comes to this topic, some person suggest that we can know a person by his habits of watching movies or reading, while others cast doubt on it.	S_T1
As for me, I don't think I can know a person by such limited imformation and we need plenty of efforts to understand a person's thought.	S_T0
First, it is always not enough to know a person well when we just know what he likes watching or reading.	S_M0
Because human are very complicated, especially in their mental aspects.	B_S0
Such as, when I was a freshman in university, my classmates and I are organized to attend a class meeting.	I_S0
At that time, we had to introduce ourselves by several words about hometown, character, interests and so on.	I_S0
I remember that a boy said he liked reading essay writen by ZhuZiqing, and hoped someone who was also interested in it can contact him.	I_S0
After that, I didn't like him since I regarded him as a female like boy.	I_S0
However, I changed my mind when I found him participate in basketball game representing our class and won the game.	I_S0
This experience influenced me a lot that I can't know a person by such imformation.	E_S0
Second, I don't think we can learn a person such easily.	B_M0
Finally, maybe the hobbies like watching and readin can help us know parts of a person, but it's not the whole person.	E_M0
When we want to understand a person's thought, this information is a great reference but can't determine personality of him.	B_S0
It's not enough.	I_S0
When we have a long time to be together with him, we can find some character that we have never known.	E_S0
Taking into account all the factors mentioned above, we could easily draw the conclusion that it's not enough	S_C2
 
With the rapid growth of human society, people's ideas also change day by day, among which young people's idea leads the trend and fashion to some extent.	S_I0
Because of this, some people hold the view that there shouldn't be so many rules for young people to follow, since some of the rules have already been out of date, and these rules could also limit the development of the whole society as well.	S_T1
On the other hand, some people believe if there were not so many rules for young people, there might be chaos.	B_T0
From my perspective, I support the first standpoind.	E_T0
First and foremost, some of the rules are indeed out of date and don't match the trend of society development any longer.	S_M1
It is widely acknowledged that ideas keep refreshing.	B_S0
Different ages may have totally different lifestyle, thus people reflect distantly depending on the ages they live in.	I_S0
For example, there used to be a widespread belief that women shouldn't work.	I_S0
Nowadays lots of people still assert that women are supposed to stay at home and do some chores.	I_S0
But the truth is, women can also do a great job when it comes to lots of field.	I_S0
There are always prominent women in various areas.	I_S0
In some families, parents forbid the girls taking education.	I_S0
I don't think these kind of rules are worth following.	E_S0
Besides, too many rules also limit the development of society.	S_M1
The most precious gifts of young people are their passion and creation.	B_S0
But if there are too many rules, their imagination may be limited.	I_S0
And even though they come up with some dramatically brilliant thought, they may be restrained by the rules.	I_S0
Therefore, the society does not have 'vehicle' to push it forward.	I_S0
Suppose a young person, who is quite creative at night, has to obey the rule that he must get to work very early in the morning, his talent would be restricted.	E_S0
Admittedly, rules do fuction a lot from certain aspects.	S_C2
But the truth is there are too many rules that are out of date and limit the develop	O
 
In the accelerating development of our society, the government pays more attention on people's daily life.	B_I0
Many particular fields need government's financial support.	I_I0
Some people contend that government should spend more money on Internet access, it is true that people's life is attained to the Internet, the investment in the Internet access will help a lot.	E_I0
However, I strongly believe that the government should spend money on public transportation, because that can help the environment and the traffic safety.	S_T1
Firstly, spending money on public transportation helps with environment and health problems.	S_M1
To be specific, the carbon dioxide will be reduced, that slows down the speed of global warming.	B_S0
As we know, most public transportations use the gas as the energy source, in the procession, many carbon dioxide is produced.	I_S0
If the government wants to decline the great amout of carbon dioxide, some clean energy source can get used, such as the electric energy and solar energy.	I_S0
The devolpment of technology needs a lot of money, if the government give financial help to the scientists, the new energy source can be quickly accessible.	I_S0
Thus the country's air condition will improve, the health level of people will incline too, so government can also save money in the medical field.	E_S0
Moreover, traffic condition improves with the money with public transportation.	S_M1
In other words, less accidents will happen.	B_S0
If the government puts more money in public transportation, some old facilities can be replaced to new ones, some safe problems will no longer exist.	I_S0
In China, there was an  accident	E_S0
 
Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people:whether the time today's people spent to cooking or preparing food is more than the time people spent in twenty years.	B_I0
Opinions vary from people to people.	I_I0
Some claim that it is true that people are tend to spend much time cooking in th kitchen.	I_I0
As for me, I wholeheartedly agree that the people living in twenty years before spend much time cooking than the people living today.	E_I0
My points can be elaborated as followed.	S_T1
First of all, people have no time cooking by themselves.	S_M2
As we all know, nowadays, most people fight for their living by working very hard, and there are many competitions and tasks waiting for them every day.	B_S0
So they can hardly spare time to enjoying a meal, how can they have time to cook and prepare the foods by themselves?	I_S0
Take myself as a example.	I_S0
I used to work in the Tencent company, and I always stayed up late into midnight because the task was too hard for me to finish before the due day.	I_S0
Only on the weekend, I can stay at home and cook an easy dinner for myself, which just cost me about half and hour because I wanted to spent most of my resting time sleeping or watching some movies to relax myself.	E_S0
In addition, there are many choices for people to select how can they have for a meal now.	S_C2
As we all know, fast food restaurants have sprung up recent years and more and more people are fond of this delicious food because fast food is cheap and do not need to wait as the process of making it is very simple.	B_S0
Unlike the traditional food which cost people plenty of time and money to cook it, various versions of food gets popular easily.	I_S0
For example, my cousin is a cook, however, he never cooks at home because he is more likely to buy something to eat in the fast food restaurants which have lots of recipes for him to choose.	I_S0
And he can even have different meals in one month in the same restaurant.	E_S0
 
Many individuals believe that there is no need for people to know about events happening around the world since it will waste their time to concern something which seems not related to themselves.	B_I0
After all, when I heard a news about flu of headache spread out in Beijing recentlly which caused a lot of people sick, but I don't really care about it because I'm not living in Beijing now.	E_I0
However, I still agree that those events happening aroud the world is worthy to be known although they are not actualy related to us.	S_T0
Firstly, I think that nobody can know what will happened in the future exactly.	S_M1
Those events happened around the world are possibily happened just beside us.	B_S0
As we know that For exmple the Economic risks.	I_S0
When the first time I heard about the Economy risk happeded in America, I was not care about it.	I_S0
However, when the Economy risk happened in China, I finaly realized that how important it is.	I_S0
The inflation is getting more and more serious and it also influenced my family a lot.	E_S0
Secondly, if we know about some events around the world, it will also let us know more about other countries.	S_M1
For exmple, I want to study in Canada when I go to the university.	B_S0
In this case, I need to pay more attention on the things which happens in Canada, such as which university has the best acedadmic teaching system, or which university have a better condition for students to live.	I_S0
Once my classmates told me that my English teacher was graduate from the University of Toronto.	I_S0
I finaly realized that University of Toronto was best way to go.	I_S0
I also e-mailed my English teacher and ask her about the condition and living condition, it let me know more about that school even Canada.	E_S0
To sum up, where as there is an argument that people do not need to know about events happening around the world, namely wasting the time, coupled with better opportunity for understand still make a strong case for it si important to know some events happened around the world.	S_C2
 
The house-hold konwn celebrities often send their speeches or attend talk shows on  television.	B_I0
Also, with modern state-of-art technology, everyone could access their blogs or vedio tubes.	I_I0
Our minds are every now and then affected by the sayings.	I_I0
Some people believes that opinions of famous ones are more important to youngers than to olders.	E_I0
From my point of view, the statement is reasonable.	S_T0
To start with, youth and children put more attention on the celebirties than old people do.	S_M0
The new generation are usually more curious about and have more passion toward the world.	B_S0
In other words, young people are more likely to focus on the movement of famous ones.	I_S0
For example, teenage girls may follow the private facebook acount of music stars.	I_S0
As most of groupies are the teenagers, they would discuss more about the opinions of someone they are admired of.	E_S0
y	B_M0
Last but not least, the school age and guadurated students need sitimulation in their lives.	E_M0
The daily schoolwork and stress from workplaces may make them overwheilmed.	B_S0
In order to release their pressure on shoulders, many young people would choice to fix their eyes on famous people.	I_S0
It is not only a mean to get rid of tedious daily tasks, but also to receive information from boarder world.	I_S0
After lunch or dinner time, they would initiate communication about the celebrities and express their point of view.	I_S0
The converations is a way to blank their minds and forget about the boring reality.	E_S0
Combining the statements above, I think that young generation would certainly put the ideas of celebrities on a high ground.	B_C0
They are lack of expriences and looking forward to live a fancy life.	I_C0
The celebrities on the computer and mobilephone scenes are the mode of their dreams.	I_C0
Young people absorb the imformation and poccess the speeches into their ideas.	E_C0
 
With the development of the society, people always feel extremely tired aftering finishing their whole-day work.	B_I0
Thus, more and more people are looking for suitable ways to relax themselves.	I_I0
The opinions on ways to relax vary from people to people.	I_I0
Some people suggest that they should watch an funny movie or read the book they are interested in aftering working, while others prefer to do some outdoor exercise.	E_I0
As far as I am concerned, I hold the opinion that it's better to relax by doing physical exercise than by watching a movie or reading a book.	S_T0
Firstly, the serious fact is that more and more people feel pain in their shoulders because of a whold day working in front of the computer.	S_M1
If people still sit on their chair to watch the movies or read books, it will not do good to thier health at all.	B_S0
Only if doing some physical exercise can they cure the pain and gain a healthy body.	I_S0
Secondly, exercise will help you keep fit and get rid of some fatty problems.	I_S0
If you want to look good on the beach, doing some physical exercise must be your best choice.	I_S0
Last but not least, if you don't want to do exercise yourself or be afraid that you can't consist on everyday sports plan, you can call for some colleuges to go with you, which may enclose your relationship and help you make more friends.	E_S0
Nevertheless,many people may argue that they will feel more tired after doing sports.	S_M1
However, this can't be the reason that you say no to all exercise.	B_S0
If running for a mile makes you breathless and unbearable, you can also work for a mile.	I_S0
The way that you exercise yourself is based on yourself, which means that you can choose the most suitable way for yourself.	E_S0
In a short, doing some physical exercise can be the most suitable way after a whole-day work.	B_C1
Hope that you can find the best sports to relax yourself.	E_C1
 
in my opinon, i agree with the statement.	S_T1
firstlym phsical exercise need to ues a loy of ebnergy, so it is possible to be more tired  secondly, when you watch a movie or read a book you dong't need to think a lot.	B_S1
just follow the development of the story and get entertainment nd relaxyourself thirdly sport need many people taking part in doing physical exercise alone is not interesting at all or need a book whenever you want, when you fisishi a whole day studying and back to domitory you are too tired to take an exercise reading is the best way to relax so i think rading or watchingmovies are much better than physical exercise.	E_S1
 
In fact,is true that many parents give their children some money after they have got a high grade.	S_I0
But I think using this way to encourage children isn't  good .	S_T0
Their scool-age children maybe just too young,they don't know how to keep money or how to spend it.	B_S0
And the money perhaps become a thing which they show-off to satisfy their vanity.	I_S0
They will also compare wtih their firends:how much money did I get.	E_S0
And in our real  life,we can see many news about this topic too.	S_M1
Last week, I see a nes on TV,that a 12-year-old child spent 2000yuan on TAOBAO to purchase something for game.	B_S0
And this money came from his last test.	I_S0
He has got 100 on math;his father gave him 5000 to encourage him.	I_S0
I was totally shock when I heard the news.	I_S0
This phenomenon might happen in my scool life,but it wasn't so serious.	I_S0
I've realized that is a very big problem now.	I_S0
As I've mentioned before,the school -age children didn't know how to spend money at all,they just buy the things they want,they don't care about if it's expensive or useful.	I_S0
And these money probably let them waste the money...	I_S0
There are so many disadvantage.	E_S0
On the other hand,encouraging children propriately is  important too.	S_M1
But we should not give moneyto them.	B_S0
Money can purchase many things but it has many negative effects too.	I_S0
We can praise them or cook a good meal for them or take them to watch the movie which they like the most.	I_S0
But I think we should avoid the prize physical.	E_S0
In my opinon,offer their scool-age children for their high grade is a bad idea to encourage children.	B_C0
But we shouldn't forget to encourage them.	I_C0
We should let they konw：they are good,they do the best.	E_C0
 
As parents attach more and more importance to a child's grade in school, they begin to think of as  ways as possible in order to encourge their child to perform better in the lessons.	S_I0
One choice is to reward them by offering things that they want, such as books, toys, video games, etc.	S_T0
As days move on, some parents start to set money as a reward for the high grade.	B_T1
In my perspective, I am totally agree with this kind of encouragement.	E_T1
The reasons are describled below.	S_S2
Money is needed even by the school-age children, therefore it is encouraging for the children to get a good mark in the school.	S_M1
They may use money to buy things that they really want instead of accepting the gifts offered by their parents.	B_S0
This is a motivation of high grade in school.	I_S0
When I was in the elementary, I was always hoping to own my football so that I could organize my friends to play together, and parents promised that they would offer me some money to buy a football or whatever I like, if I got a good mark on the coming math exam.	I_S0
By that means, I worked very hard and eventually I was rewarded by the money.	E_S0
To provide money for the high grade teaches children how to earn money by their own hands.	S_M1
As children are not capable to do other works to gain money for their own use.	B_S0
What could they do if they feel like not demanding from their parents for doing nothing.	I_S0
Therefore, parents find a reason to give them the chance to show that even children have the ability to earn some money, by working hard and getting a high grade, this will increase a child's fulfillment, which is a helpful way to gain an independent character, as indicated by some developmental psychologists.	E_S0
Although, to encourage the child by offering money may mislead their intention of study, it is actually a good way to make sure that they have acquire the basic knowledge for their further study and even contains a good impact on their career in the future.	B_C0
As it is known to us all, that children prefer to play and study makes them upset.	I_C0
And this fact results in a failure of the grade which may leads to a more profund negative impact on children, worse is that children are not able to notice that.	I_C0
Parents, as a consequence, should not only persuade them to learn hard by talking but also they are obliged to offer some direct reward, just as some video games could provide them, money is a better choice.	E_C0
 
With the economic versatily development, many new type  occupation occured.	B_I0
Some of them requires multiple ability for only one job, some of them ask only one specific ability to conquer the position.	E_I0
I believe that workers have different types of task are feel more fulfilling than workers do similar tasks all day long.	S_T1
workers doing different type of tasks can earn more self -esteem.	S_M0
There is a saying : people who have ability always handle the most work.	B_S0
workers who doing different type of work exactly showed that they have the ability to handle the work.	I_S0
When they finish different projects, or when they dealing with different problem, those will also make them feel that they are important for the company, The position they stand for needs them.	I_S0
When mental needs satificated, workers are more likely to work from the inside of their heart.	I_S0
On the contrary,workers doing similar tasks all day long may feel more like a spcialized machine, they may also feel my position could also be substitued by other people because of the single type of work they are facing.	I_S0
As a consequence, they may lose the interst of work and have lower self-valuate.	E_S0
workers who have a different tasks to do also make them have more farsight about their career development.	S_M0
When university students first looking for a job, they are not exactly know whta kind of job they like or they are good at.	B_S0
Some times , the job people like and the job people are good at can be totally contradictory.	I_S0
So have a viaravle type of work can also provide a chance for them to discorver which aspects they are good at.	I_S0
People always do good when they know they like it or they know they are good at it .	I_S0
This positive cycle will gradually bing the career and the company more prosper.	E_S0
admititely , workers who doing similar tasks all day can become somekind of specialty, cause they repeat the same kind of thing every workday, they will develop their rythem of the work and finish the same work in a shorter period of time, but people work different job at the same time can dramatically lower the rated of getting bored and lazy.	S_M0
Facing different tasks bings challenge and dynamic to the daily work.	S_S2
In a conclude, work different tasks  are better than work similar tasks ever	S_C2
 
With the remarkable progress of education, the tasks that the teachers assign are more and more multiple, so does the formation.	B_I0
Nowadays plenty of teachers would like to assign groupwork projects since in this way students can benefit a lot, including improving the studying efficiency.	I_I0
On the other hand, lots of people casts doubt on working together because there would be someone who rarely devote themselves into the task.	I_I0
From my perspective, I agree with that students can learn more effentively by working with others mainly for the following reasons.	E_I0
To begin with, students can learn different ideas from others towards the intact task.	S_M0
Different people have different thoughts, some are deeper and some are shallower.	B_S0
Students may see the same task from various aspects and get all kinds of ideas.	I_S0
By exchanging their thoughts through the discussion, students can have better understanding towards the assignment and may see it as a whole, thus doing a better job within a comparatively short time.	I_S0
Last time when we did our accounting homework within a group, we four girls had totally different ideas about how could technology affect the accountants, so we had a heated brainstorm.	I_S0
We not only learnt a lot from each other, but also did a really good job in this assignment.	I_S0
We were highly praised by the professor for the amazing ideas from different aspects.	E_S0
On top of that, students can concentrate more when working together.	S_M0
When cooperating with others, people can't help considering about their own impression on others, which can lead them to show their responsibility.	B_S0
So they will totally devote themselves into the task and stay more focus.	I_S0
Let's go back to the last example, we four girls paid high attention when doing the assignment.	I_S0
We almost spent all the time looking for the information and discussing without anybody doing anything elss.	I_S0
So we finished it within two days, although if we did on our own, it would take us much longer.	E_S0
Admittedly, there will be somebody wants a free-ride.	S_M0
They want to do nothing but the score.	B_S1
If the teachers can tell them the bad comsequence, this situation can be avoided.	E_S1
To sum up, working together can improve the study efficiency because we can be more consntrated and responsible.	S_C2
 
Some surprise will happen in your class, when you sitting in classroom, and you make your points.	B_I0
But your teacher and class leader interrupted you and said that your opinion was wrong, So what do you do at this time?	I_I0
Your interrupt them and correct the mistake swiftly; wait for the class over and then talk to them or just be quiet?	E_I0
In my perspective, I will wait for the class over and when people are gone, then talk to the teacher or meeting leader.	S_T1
First and formost, If your talk about your mistake or incorrect after the class, which you can give them more respective and also can build a strong relationship between you and your teacher.	S_M0
For instance, I remember last year, when I study in the high-school, I always make give an incorrect idea in the class.	B_S0
Then, teacher was always say I am wrong, however I do not interrupt them and just be quiet.	I_S0
When class is over, I am run to the office and talk about my incorrect idea.	I_S0
The teacher believe that I gave them enough respective.	I_S0
So When  I by mistake again, I am always talk to the teacher after the class.	I_S0
Besides, my teahers are prefer to helps me  to stud when the text came.	E_S0
In addition, explain you incorrect after the class will save the study time, not only yours and also your classmates.	S_M0
When you give a incorrect opinion in the class and teacher told you that is wrong.	B_S0
And then you interrupt your class, and talk about one point on the class, which will watse lot of time.	I_S0
Other students just want to study when you discuss with  your teacher, who cannot teaches students.	I_S0
SO talk to teacher when class is over is a good way to save time.	E_S0
On the contrary  some people believe that interrupt the teacher and correct the mistake right away is good.	S_M0
Because they think that can improve class atmosphere and increase students work effciency.	B_S1
On the other hand, whe you talk to the teacher on the class, you will make a	E_S1
Give the above points, it is better to talk with your teacher or meeting leader when people are gone, this is because it can give them enough perspective and save others time.	B_C1
Thus, I hope when I	E_C1
 
I don't agree with the statement that nowadays people are more willing to give a hand to strangers in need.	S_T0
First and foremost people today are too hectic to pay attention to others around them.	S_M0
It's even harder to feel sympathy for passerbys.	B_S0
Take myslef as an example.	I_S0
I have a great deal of schoolwork to be done so I usually walk quickly from home to class.	I_S0
I sometimes see people looking around as if there were lost.	I_S0
But I seldom approch them and offer help because I was so busy.	I_S0
As life getting busier and swifter, people can hardly take care of their own things not to mention paying attention to strangers.	E_S0
Secondly people today are not as benevolent as those in the past.	S_M0
To illustrate when I walk on the street these days, fewer people are willing to give money to a poor beger, most of which would simply walk past them without even spare them a glimpse, let alone to be amicable enough to do them a favor.	B_S0
While technology makes comunication easier, people are somehow getting more undetached.	I_S0
It's a pathetic trend but there's not much we can do to change it.	E_S0
Last but not least the social security system in present day is better than any time and it's simple to look for any information we might need on the internet.	S_M0
So when being put in a tight spot we are getting more accustomed to help ourselves so we might think it the same for others.	B_S0
Like when trying to get to a unfamiliar place I always look up for the map in my mobile phone, which makes me consider that other people can save the same problem by themselves thus they  don't actually need my help.	I_S0
In this way I could become less and less willing to help a stranger finding his or her way on the street.	E_S0
In summary, with the change of lifestyle and the feeling of indifference, I think people today are less generous to help a struggling stranger.	S_C2
 
Can you imagine what things would like to be if our school-age children, a new and young generation in the future always fight for higher grades just because they can get some allowance from their parents after this?	B_I0
Have you ever thought what kind of consequence would appear if children become slaves of money in such a young age just because their studying?	E_I0
Both of the answers are definitely not really optimistic, simply becasue they are just children who are in the developing process.	B_T0
Few things can be more terrible if they turn into a money-chasing people so early, this is really harmful to them.	E_T0
It is obvious that the parents are not good at cultivating children if they just giving money to children if they socre high grade.	S_M1
This kind of giving money to such a young generation would cause them to be accustomed to having a idea in mind that just good grades can bring money to us.	B_S0
So even after these children growing up, they may still have this kind of thought, even though they have good grades, their attitudes to the life will have been changed, because they still hope to get money from their parents.	I_S0
But have you ever thought what would happen to them if their parents are not exist any more?	I_S0
Can they still receiving money from their old parents?	I_S0
Obviously, they cannot, and this is why it is not a good idea to give money to childfen for each high grade.	E_S0
And also another disadvantage in this kind of behavior is existing.	S_M1
Not that every single child are genuine want to fight hard to score high grade to get money, some of them may choose to use other ways to receive higher grades, just like cheating in exams, lying to their parents that they have high grades and so forth.	B_S0
This may cause them get worse habits, becasue these habits are not moral even not legal.	I_S0
But as young children, they may don't know this, so it is easy for these children to step into wrong ways in their future lives.	I_S0
Above this, giving money to children for each high grade are not reasonable.	E_S0
As a consequence, there is no better way to encourage and praise children to admit their grades than to give money to them for each high grades.	S_C2
 
As for children's education, parents ho;d different opinions.	S_I0
Some may think children should be taught by themselves, while others insist children have to learn from their own mistakes.	S_T0
From my prospective, I argue that parents should allow their kids learn from themselves.	S_T1
First, child can not maintian as a child forever, there must be a day they will be grown up.	S_M0
At that time, their parents probably are too old to care about their children.	B_S0
So it is very neccessary to cultivate the ability of  independence, before parents get old.	I_S0
Furthermore, if parents do not teach their kids how to learn from themselves, the children will be in trouble when their parents can not give them care as much as the past.	E_S0
On the second point, learning from themselves is also a much effective way to make progress in their life process.	S_M0
People always say that life is the best teacher, which means the youth can learn most from life comparing to others teaching methods.	B_S0
That make me think of my friends in high school.	I_S0
He is a students who pretty loves video games.	I_S0
His parents always told him to study hard.	I_S0
And warned him that he would never get a good job which can afford him to buy more games.	I_S0
However, he did not fully understand that.	I_S0
After that, there was a opportunity to experience work in a real situation.	I_S0
That experience made him feel the diificulty in social life.	I_S0
Learning from that experience, he finally knew why he need to study hard.	I_S0
That indicates learning from ourselves usually is the most effective way.	E_S0
Additionly, altough there may exist dangerous and risk when children learning from themselves, we have to see the good side.	S_M0
Everything have two sides, and we can not only see the negtive one.	B_S1
Comparing to facing the uncertain diffculties in their life, it is more terrible they don not know what to do when they meet difficulties in the future.	E_S1
All in all, allow kids to learn from themslves can reduce the parenting caring pressure and is more effective in education.	B_C1
I believe only difficultyes can train a successful man.	E_C1
 
Children don't know anything, so parents should keep thier eyes on their children every time to make sure their kids won't make mistakes.	B_S0
That kind of theories are usually around parents.	I_S0
Should parents really need to stop thier kids to make mistakes every time?	I_S0
The answer is no, because if children did't make mistakes or fix mistake when they were young ,after they grow up, they will still make mistakes and they don't have any experences for these mistakes.	I_S0
They won't konw how to fix the problens they make, then the problems are going to become bigger.	E_S0
Usually parents don't want their own kids have bad habits or bad experence, they are always tell their kids what should they do or what they should not do.	S_M2
They are afaird that kids are going to casue problem for adults, so when children got use to ask their parents what they should do or what they should not to do.	S_S2
In fact it is an	O
 
I think it is necessary to reward children when they get good mark.	S_T0
However,the rewards can be kinds of things instead of only money.	S_T1
In my opinion,children may use the money to do anything they want without the ability to exactly evaluate what is wrong or good.	S_T0
Taking myself as an example,actually,my parents used to reward me with money when I become the top student in my calss or win the prize in some contest.	S_M2
At the beginning,I just use the money to buy snacks or toys.	B_S0
But someday I found that I could use the money ask others to do my homework and I paid them.	I_S0
I learned it from a cartoon.	I_S0
I can still remenber clearly how I think of this kind of behavior in that moment.	I_S0
Since I had always been the top student,there was no need for me to do those boring homework.	I_S0
A month later,there was no doubt that I failed in the middle test.	I_S0
As a consequence,my parents and teacher found out what I had done.	I_S0
They criticized me severely determined to not give money even I am back to the top.	I_S0
However,I could not spare no effect to study once I realized that I could not get any reward even if I am diligent.	I_S0
Then my dad held a family meeting.	I_S0
After a long time discussion,we reach to the agreement that as long as I can get good grades(not must be the top student),I can get a book I want.	E_S0
So,do not rewa	S_S2
 
Nowadays, some sudents will get some gifts from their parents because these students get high mark in the exam.	B_I0
Some student gave a lesson from their parents because their kids didn't get high marks from the examinations.	E_I0
In my opinion, parents should give the school-age children some money to use in school.	S_T0
Firstly, the students will continue to work hard for study.	S_M0
The kids encouraged by the money, they also want to get more money from their parents, so their will work hard and get high attention to the study.	B_S0
What's more, they can have more money to deal with their demands.	I_S0
Their parents will satisfied from this condition.	E_S0
Secondly, the students can use this money to expand their interests.	S_M0
In some researches, the students who ge high grades from the exam often have a lot of interests.	B_S0
The students get the money for their interests, the interests open the students' mind and teach them how to solve problems.	I_S0
Interests help the students to face the hard problems.	I_S0
Like making models ,this teach the students how to keep patients.	I_S0
Give money to students who have high grades,  give the students a chance to meet their interests as well.	I_S0
It's a good thing for the students.	E_S0
Lastly, the students get moeny from their parents, this let the students to become independent.	S_M0
The students how to use their money is a big deal.	B_S0
This help the students to slove the economic problems in normal life.	I_S0
The money also help the students to think about how to deal with the money and when they use their money is useful.	I_S0
In fact, the students use their money also trained their mind , this also help them become more logical.	I_S0
Parents will happy from this.	E_S0
The money give to the students more or less help the students to control their spending easily and they will continue to work hard to get more money from their parents.	B_C0
Parents watch their kids work hard for study, they will excited from this.	I_C0
They also happy to watch that their kids get good grades.	E_C0
 
Nowadays people treat education more importantly than usual,parents have created many new methods to encourage their children to become more passionated in study.	S_T0
For example,parents give their children moneys as a rewards for getting good grades in school.	B_T1
But it has been caused wide public concern.	E_T1
Some people think it will change children's opinion on study,children may think money is the only purpose in study.	B_T0
Other people including me contend that giving money to children as a reward is a good choice.	E_T0
First,givig money to children as a reward can encourage children study harder.	S_M0
It can make them think study is a happy job instead of a boring duty after doing a lots of exercises,reading passages,working out math problems.	B_S0
So they may keep their interest in their study through tis menthod.	I_S0
If they could use the money to buy what they want as a gift, they will pursue the good mark harder.	E_S0
Another reason drives me to indicate is that,financial thinking as an important ability is useful to the modern people,in this conditions,we should teach our children how to use their money correctly.	S_M0
During this method that giving money as a reward,children will have a chance to manage their own money.	B_S0
they can know how to save money,huow to use money creats more money.	I_S0
I t is benefical for their development.	E_S0
Of course,it is unwise to give much money once a time when children get a good mark,since that the children will seek only for money during their study.	S_M0
we should make sure that children will not misunderstand the meaning of the reward and keep a health attitude to the money.	S_S2
Judging from what I have mentioned above, I should reinforce my perspective that it is good for parents to give their children money as a reward for getting high mard in school.	S_C2
 
In this time, the information exploid.	B_I0
Everyday we can get information from televation, phone family members and our co-workers.	E_I0
Even we can get a lot of information everyday, it is difficult for us to distinguish which one is true.	B_T0
Therefore, in my opinion, getting information from different news sources is not a good way we can be well-informed.	E_T0
In the first place, we will gain the different information about one event from different news sources.	S_M0
Take my sister as an instance, I heard that my sister will marry.	B_S0
I am highly interested about what the person my sister will marry with.	I_S0
Then I ask a lot of people connected with my sister.	I_S0
My mother says that that man works in a computer corporation.	I_S0
I think that good.	I_S0
However, my uncle tells that man is an egineer.	I_S0
The different answers are highly confusing for me and I ask my sister this question finally.	I_S0
My sister tells me that her husband's major is egineering and he one worked in a computer company.	I_S0
Nowadays he become a dentist because he can not afford the pressure in the company.	I_S0
In this society, more and more news sorces transfer the incorrect information to you even they have not check out this information.	E_S0
In the second place, we can get the incorrect information from a public news sources rather than many different news sources.	S_M0
Take myself as an instance.	B_S0
I am a big fan of basketball.	I_S0
I always want keep the pace with the change in the NBA.	I_S0
Therefore, I aways search the information about player exchange between the team on the internet.	I_S0
Nevertheless, it is confusing that the different network has different information and the majority of that information are wrong.	I_S0
This behavior not only wastes my time but also lets me lost in the wrong information.	I_S0
Passing this experience, I never believe the information from unpublic news sources online.	I_S0
I only focus on the public America basketball news.	I_S0
These news sources are highly incorrect and that save my large time.	I_S0
When there are a varieaty of information list infront of you, you must not distinguish shem and just follow the public news sources.	E_S0
Some people think that different news sources can completely show us the information.	S_M0
This point is not possible.	B_S1
In this society, more and more news sources make up the fake information in order to make profits.	E_S1
To sum up, we can not get information from different news sources because that behaviour has not sence and waste time.	B_C1
We can just follow the public news sources or check out the trues.	E_C1
 
When we talk about the expenditure of govenment in education, it will arouse the debate.	S_T1
Some people think young children should get fund from government in order to develop a successful country.	B_T0
However, I believe that it is more indispensible for government to spend monry on universities.	I_T0
My view can be illustrated as follows.	E_T0
To begin with, young children can get better than before.	S_M2
Because if university get enough fund, the students in the university will have sufficient resource to study how to educate the new generation well.	B_S0
So when the students gruduated from univerisities, they will work in the primary school and tech young children in effective and efficient way.	I_S0
Thus, young children can get suitable and profession knowledge and skills to face to the challenge and risks.	I_S0
With this kind of good education, it is necessary  for them to build up the country well.	I_S0
On the contrary, if govrment fund the young children rather than universities, university student will have defficient resource to do the research even cannot find job.	I_S0
They will not give any useful information and knowlege to the new generation children.	I_S0
For example, in Wuhan,China, government pay more attention to university students' and give them considerable finance support.	I_S0
The students in Wuhan University organize education service to the young children and graduates work in the primary school.	I_S0
Later on, the teacher had teched many scientist which were involving country construction.	E_S0
In additon, university students can payback government quickly.	B_C0
Because university students have enough knowledge, when they get support they can creat production fast.	I_C0
These production will encourage the development of society.	E_C0
But if government give the fund to the young child, it will be a long time until they can do something develop the country.	B_S0
People even not sure whether the children will have talent and skill to improve the country.	I_S0
For example, my brother John get the country help funding fron goverment and he want to appriciate the fund study hard.	E_S0
He become a lawer and help the	O
 
Nowadays there are many parents offer their school-aged children prize if they get high marks in their school.	S_I0
Some supportors claim that this way is a best way to encourage the children to study hard in school since money is a good motivate factor,and also is the most useful way to motivate people.	B_T1
However,from my perspective,it is not a good way for parents to give money as a reward for good grades.	E_T1
First of all,children will think that study is only for more changes but not for their own future.	S_M1
School-aged children is in a process of growing their own value conception system.	B_S0
If in this process you just give money to your children as a reward,he or she will think get money is the most importent things for people to do everything，not for their emotion,for their family and for their friendships.	I_S0
They will not gain happiness from everything except money,it means that they cannot survial in the society well,because they don not know how to get along with people.	E_S0
Secondly,the school-aged children cannot control doing things they like when they get too much money.	S_M1
Becuase people do not have ability to manage their money at this age and they may spend their money on some harmful things.	B_S1
For instance,when a child get too much money from his parents,and he likes playing computer games,he will go to the internet club to play computer games,as he plays the things that he likes,he may be addicted into the computer games and it may affect his study and also may damage his future.	E_S1
In general,it's not good to give money to school-aged children when they get good grades,it may affect their development of value conception system,and it also may make them to be addicted into harmful things.	S_C2
I hope that every parents should avoid giving children m	O
 
In my view,the conduct which some parents have done with their school-age childen is a good idea if the degree is proper.	B_I0
If their children got a high grade,money will be a attractive prize for them.	I_I0
But,how much money and how many of the encourage should parents gave?	E_I0
It is a more important thing to considerate.	S_T0
Two reasons that i want to say about my opinions.	S_M2
Firstly,a few of children may have many sweet thing to buy,just for their intrest,but parents think that it just a moment intrest,not worth to buy.	B_S0
If they can get money by their effort on studying,it can boost their energy about it.	I_S0
At the same time,we can see that children usually do not have a good knowledge of money,maybe they buy plenty of doll or little thing which is not worthy to buy  so that form a waste view about money.	I_S0
So parent should controll the quantity of the prize in order to make it provide the best function.	I_S0
And then,a better life opinion that you should harvist what you want by your effort can be form and have an far-reaching imposion on them.	E_S0
Above all ,my attention about parents offer their school-age children money for their high grade they get in school is netrial.	B_C1
If you use it in a proper way,it will be a good prize ,make children happy,energy,and love you much...	E_C1
If not,the influent is more worse and serious.	S_S2
May be parents can find other means without money to encourage children to learn hard	O
 
Some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.	S_I0
But I do not think this is a good idea.	B_T0
I have this opinion for these reasons.	E_T0
First,if they can get money from their good grade,they may damage all to high grade.	S_M0
If they cannot solve the problems,they may copy others anwser.	B_S0
In this way,their high grade is not true,and they may have problems on that,but teachers do not that.	I_S0
And children will fall behind.	E_S0
Second, they will sudy for money.	S_M0
Because they konw if they get high grade,they can have more money,so they study hard.	B_S0
But when their parent do not give them money, they will stop studying because they think it is not fair.	I_S0
But they all will graduate from high school and go to  university and social,their parents cannot follow them forever.	I_S0
At that time, they may have big problems on studying.	E_S0
Third,if a child have a lot of money, he may use money very often.	S_M0
If a child can get money just from a high grade, he may think make money is very easy and waste money.	B_S1
If he have habit on wasting money,when he grow up,his money will always not enough.	E_S1
For these three reasons, I think parents cannot always give their children for their high grade.	B_C0
But someone may say if children cannot get any prizes from high grade,they will have no interest in studying.	I_C0
I mean you cannot give them money, but you can give them any little gifts.	I_C0
Such as a chocolate,a doll.	I_C0
You can also take them to wacth a film,or to the zoo.	I_C0
This kind of gifts not only cheer them up,but also let children and parents relationship more close.	I_C0
And your children will love you.	I_C0
So I think offer children money for each high grade is not a good idea.	E_C0
 
Regardless of the increasing working time towords modern people, how to arrange our schedule is still a debateble question.	B_I0
Comfort is still regarded as the most cherished factor when it comes to evaluating a job arrangement.	I_I0
therefore, it has been widely admitted that someone choose to work for five days for shorter hours as most of people do.	E_I0
However, according to my preference and experience, there are three factors why three-days work is more facsinating to me.	S_T0
The primary reason for my view is that people who work for three days will have a higher efficiency of working.	S_M0
It is because that people will be concentrating more on one thing rather than doing different things in one day.	B_S0
For instance, last month, I was supposed to write a paper for electrical engineering, in the first week, I decided to write the paper for five hours per day, and have leisure time after work.	I_S0
But later on I felt it is hard for me to concentrate on what I was doing, because after I had relaxed for a while, the temptation of resting make it impossible for me to keep my mind on the work, which lead to a low efficiency.	I_S0
Then I changed my plan to work for a whole day to write the paper and finished it in only three days.	I_S0
It is natural to conclude that If people can arrange their working time in a shorter time, they will have higher speed of working.	E_S0
Another reason why I believe working in three days is betteris that it will be more flexible for people to arrange their schedule if they have more time to spare.	S_M0
Imagine, when you may have several party or appointment in a week, is not a challenge to adjust the time for a five-days working person？	B_S0
On the contrary, if a perpson should only work for three days in a week, it will be convenient for him to manage his time because there will be two more days free for him to socilize.	I_S0
After all, Arranging the work time into  a short period make a person's schedule more free.	E_S0
Admittedly, although working for a short hours in a day is relaxing for most of people, working for 3 days can make people have more days to release their pressure.	S_M0
To sum up, working for 3 days per week is bet	S_C2
 
I think it is not the best way to phrise the students with moneye .	B_T1
As we all kown,studing is our personal thing.	E_T1
It means that we should be independent to study in our own ways,whether the result is good or not.	S_T0
Students should study for themselves,they can use the after schools time to do the part time job.	S_M2
However,we should study for konwledges not for the money.	B_S0
Once your children get money for each high grade,they will be proud of themselves rather than study harder.	I_S0
Steve,my classmate,is the typical example of that,his parents always offer him lots of money,because of the good grades he got.	I_S0
But if his parents arangement improved,or he can not reach the asked marks,he will be less confident,which is the worst situation.	I_S0
A s a result,he is not interested in study,he become lazy,and his marks got lower and lower.	I_S0
Now he has devote himself to the computer games.	I_S0
That is the result of offer money for high grade.	I_S0
So it is not the best way,even not the good way.	I_S0
The best way, I think,is to get our students interested in it.	I_S0
It turned out that  phrise the students with money is not wise,so why do not we chosse the bbeter way.	I_S0
The best students will not even matter you to froce them,they will learn by themselves.	I_S0
Insteated of the money,i think the books,and pens,will be better to phrise the students.	E_S0
I wish this will be helpful and useful.	S_C2
 
It's undeniable that relaxation is an indispensable part of our life.	S_I0
Nevertheless, when it comes to the efficient relaxing method, our choices vary from person to person.	B_T1
For instance, I prefer to watch a movie or read a book to relax rather than do physical exercise.	E_T1
First of all, doing physical exercise will inevitablely consume energy, which will eventually make you even more exhausted.	S_M2
As far as I am concerned, getting home with tired body and clothes immersed by sweat are never goning to become synoymous with effective relaxation.	B_S0
By contrast, watching a movie or reading a book dose not require any physical movement.	I_S0
Moreover, when watching a movie , you can find yourself a cozy comfortable position to save your body out of the bland work before.	I_S0
There is no need for instensive physical action for your body to suffer any more.	I_S0
Secondly, while doing physical execise make enhance your body strength, reading a book or watching a movie is capable of enriching your spiritual world.	I_S0
It is conspicuously acknowledged that spiritual happiness and gratitude overwhelm a strong body.	I_S0
During the progress, you might learn something about dealing with daily annoyance while laugh out loud at some really hilarious scenes.	I_S0
In a more positive light, while your mind enjoyed a leisure time, your body will simultaneously restore its strength from the consumption before, preparing you for another session of work or study.	E_S0
As has mentioned above, the method of relaxation may be diverse, therefore, one's personal preference is most likely to suit himself only.	B_C0
Chances are that doing physical exercise like running for 2000 meters strength the man's body and in the mean time give him the sense of achievement of finishing a tough task.	I_C0
Thus, it's even more significant for everyone not only to relax but also discover the precisely right way for himself to relax.	E_C0
 
Many people think that working five days a week for shorter houes is more enjoyable than working only three days for long hours.	S_I0
Because they think they can have enough time to finish their tasks, and these can make them relaxing.	B_T0
But, I do not think so, personally speaking, although working for a long time, it can help us the ability of  focusing on doing something.	E_T0
First, working three days a week for along hours, which means we can have enough time to rest and to reduce the pressure which are made of working time.	S_M1
For example, my uncle is a worker, and he has many tasks need him to accomplish, but there are two options to him to choose.	B_S0
Working only three days but long hours or working five days but for shourt hours.	I_S0
At last, he chooses the first method unhesitatingly , because in his perspective, he can have four days to relax himslf, and if he can finish the task in a short , which can make him more efficient.	E_S0
Second, many work need the workers to work interruptedly, becase the work is very specific.	S_M1
To illusrate, the cop, who manage the traffic.	B_S0
The cars on the road all time and they need some to administrat, so the cops play a essencial role in this process.	I_S0
Therefore , the cop need to work for long hours but few days a week.	I_S0
If they do not do this, they can not hand over very well.	I_S0
And it will be very difficult to manage the traffic.	E_S0
In conclusion, I think work for a long hours but few days a week will be more enjoyable.	B_C0
It can make us more efficient and we can focus on doing something.	I_C0
It's agood idea.	E_C0
 
An interesting discussion has arisen smog people: the rules that societies today expect young people to follow and obey are too strict.	B_I0
Different people have distinctive opinions.	I_I0
Part of them suggests that young people just green hand so that these strict social rules are not suitable in young people.	I_I0
The other people, however, hold the opposite view.	E_I0
From my perspective, I strongly believe that the social  rules seem to be strict, but it is can help young people to be a better person.	S_T0
First and foremost, even though the rules for young people are strict, social rules can make young people have a better mean to grow.	S_M2
To be more specific, these rules can guide the young people to prevent them go astray.	B_S0
For instance, some young people involved in drugs.	I_S0
If do not have these strict rules in the social life, it will become more and more young people imitate  the same thing so that these  young people will losing control by the dangerous drugs.	I_S0
As a result, these rules can make young people avoid these terrible mistakes.	E_S0
Social rules can make young people ha	S_S2
 
In contemporary international events, with no doubt has never be ignored by many, especially students.	B_I0
As it's increasing impact on daily life, more and more heated disscussions appear over related issues.	I_I0
One of the most representative controversies goes  whether we should to know events happening around the world or not, even if it is unlikely  that they will affect your daily life.	I_I0
Some claim that it's uneccessary to care them.	E_I0
From my perspective however, I believe they are very benificial to my life.	S_T0
In the first place, it can increase my knowlege.	S_M1
If people wants to find a relaxed way to studying, watching itenational news will be the proper way to reach that goal, especially for students their political exams often have something refer to the international events.	B_S0
So, this way could help the students get a great grade on their academic performence.	I_S0
On the contrary those students who do the opposite of the picture are more likely to see the difference.	I_S0
They will easily find fail on the exam.	E_S0
In this case the improtance of knowing international news is easily be stressed In the second place.	S_M1
Knowing international news will easily help me make more friend, due to when people having a chat, students prefer to look for someone who understand a lot of, For example if my friends are talking about foreign sport star, they will easily find students who often watch sport news, because the students could provide them with certain information as they want.	B_S0
Contrastly if someone fail to do the same, they aren't easily to expand their friend's circle.	I_S0
So, that's the reason why in most case students still tend to know some international events.	I_S0
Apparently, it dominates a lot.	E_S0
Granted there is still a minority people disagree with my opinion, in their eyes to watch these events is seems to waste their time.	B_C1
However what they ignored is the key point that in realit, most people will turn to know some sorts of the events rather than absolutely unfamiliar with it, for the former one brings more benefits  All in all, from whta has been stressed above an evident conclusion can be easily reached that, it's important to know about events happening around the world t	E_C1
 
Like the availability people's can get from highly-developed technology, it also brings out the bad effects on people's daily lives admittedly.	B_I0
Some supporters claims that people now are lack of happiness and satisfaction compared to the past.	E_I0
As far as I'm concered, I agree with this idea.	S_T1
It's obvious that the changing world make our life-standard improved, and we can get what we want more easily than in the past.	S_M1
It seems to be easier that we have more opportunities to satisfy our demands.	B_S0
However, the increasing living-standard also means the rapidly-expand price of products.	I_S0
People now need to make much more effert to earn money as much as possible so that they can chase with the inceasing price level.	I_S0
The high-pressure work and the competition between people will make them become tired out.	I_S0
Even though they can get what they are willing to consume, they may not gain the happiness from that.	E_S0
To begin with, the relationship between neighbors and colleges have more distance now.	S_M1
The increasing population represents the more establishing buildings, which means that the gap betweem people and people become harder and harder.	B_S0
The neighbors now may even not know each others, and they never help their neighbors or ask their neighbors for help even though they are getting trouble.	I_S0
In contrast, it's one of the most pleasure time for used people to chat with their neighbors.	I_S0
They would talk about their own Secondly, the rapid changes will take people a lot of time to adjust, and the time for adapting is qiuet uncomfortable especially for those elder people.	I_S0
The phones are changing everyday, and new generations are always being invented; the variable paying methods let the bank note seem useless; one doesn't use the advanced technology will easily be regarded as outdate person.	E_S0
In conclusion, the changes of world can render people become more stressful and depressed which have conflicts with our expectancy.	B_C0
The alert awarness and lackness of emotion between people, the time which taken to adapt the changes both refer people tired and hopeless.	I_C0
As a result, I agree with the point that people are less happy than were in the past.	E_C0
 
With the development of technoloy and science, we need high degreed on our study.	S_I0
And "Working alone or working in team" is an important issue in our daily life.	S_T1
I strongly agree that we should work in team which is good for us to improve	S_T0
Firstly,it is a good way to improve our effiency.	S_M1
Although work alone provides us a private and quiet enivorment to achieve our projects.	B_S0
But we may encounter some troubles which may spend such a long time to overcome.	I_S0
It is so time-consuming and you might made a wrong solution with the problem.	I_S0
Once I was a middle school student, I usually did my homework alone.	I_S0
And I did my math homework for a full-night because I did not understand a point in the math class.	I_S0
However, since I choose to write homework with my classmates after school.	I_S0
I finish my work in a short time and I also have time to have some entainments.	I_S0
My grade enhanced a lot due to the teamwork.	E_S0
Moreover, working in team is better for our development.	S_M1
Working with other students provide our an opportunity to enhance our horizen during discussion with other peole who have more studing experiences and skills.	B_S0
We can learn the advantages from each other.	I_S0
Sometimes, it will have a brainsteam which provide our more motivated and inspirad ideas for our project.	I_S0
Take me as an example, I met a excellent member in a teamwork project.	I_S0
He not only help me on the project but also give me some useful suggestions for me to choose the job.	I_S0
The suggestions are benefit for me in the interview.	I_S0
Luckly, I found the well-paid job that I really appericate after my graduate.	E_S0
Last but not least, working together can improve our social ability which become more and more important in our society.	S_C2
 
I don't agree with the following statement.	S_T0
A leader could become a famous man by himself,but he till have some important things effects him.	B_T1
Leaders are influenced by the environment.	I_T1
Leaders have an indomitable spirit.	E_T1
Leaders are born and I  agree,but I  have to look at my goals.	B_T0
Being  a leader takes time ,not  inborn.	E_T0
Firstly,leaders are influenced by the environment.	S_M1
If there is no environment for the cultivation of leaders,then can be no leaders.	B_S1
For example,Mr.Jobs had never thought of becoming apple's boss if he had not been influenced by the successful,the environment is important to leaders,and these different environments will stimulate the leader and make him better.	E_S1
Secondly, leaders have an indomitable spirit.	S_M1
leaders are all through the process of pain , no  rain , no rainbow ,if the leaders didn't have some problems need to deal with ,the leaders wouldn't be successed  actually.	B_S1
For example , Tom was a big company boss,he got so much problems in his special life ,if he gave up ,the boss must be else.	E_S1
some suceesd people had a specia; common,it is hard working, nobody will be a leader natura	O
 
Issues related to choosing jobs have never failed attract people' s attention.	B_I0
Recently, a heated debated topic arose in the public: whether people can benefit more by choosing jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs than choosing jobs that are very different from their parents.	E_I0
Some people believe that it is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents.	B_T0
However, in the ultimate analysis, I contend that children can benefit more by choosing jobs that are quite diffrent from their parents' jobs.	E_T0
To begin with, having jobs which are different from the jobs of the parents helps students  to develop themselves.	S_M1
To be more specific, if children have very different jobs from those of their parents, it means that their parents are not familiar with their children' s jobs.	B_S0
Thus, it is hard for the parents to provide help for their children.	I_S0
So, when children encounter difficulties in their work such as failling to complete projects, being confusing about the information of the jobs and so on, they only can depend on themselves.	I_S0
Thus, children can do their utmost and explore new knowledge on their own to solve the problems.	I_S0
it is more likely for them to develop and have ability to find solutions of problems in the future.	I_S0
On the contrary, if children have jobs that are similar to the jobs of their parents, it is more likely for their parents to offer them help when they are in trouble.	I_S0
Therefore, it is more possible for the children to rely on their parents to give their help.	I_S0
It is hard for them to make progress.	E_S0
In the second place, children can study more knowledge if they own jobs which are different with their parents' jobs.	S_M1
As  children can study lots of information in the field of jobs that they choose.	B_S0
Also, they can be conducted different kind of information about the area of their parents' jobs.	I_S0
Therefore, children can have more knowledge.	I_S0
Take my sister as an example, she liked art very much so she chose to become an artist when she graduated, whereas her mother was an engineer and her father was a doctor.	I_S0
She told me that she gained lots of more professional skills when she worked.	I_S0
And her father told her some medical knowledge so that she could take care of herself and know when she sicked, what kinds of medicines she needed to eat.	I_S0
Her mother also taught her knowledge about math and engineering, it helps my sister improved a lot.	I_S0
So, she became knowledgable and she was more likely to become a well-rounded person.	E_S0
To conclude, judging from all the reasons listed above, I stronger believe that it is more beneficial for children to choose jobs that are quite different from their parents.	B_C1
For children, they can not only develop themselvs but also become more knowledgeable.	E_C1
 
I think it is by yourself .	S_T1
If your children good at manage,you can give your children more money ,if you children good at spend money,it is not a good ideas.	B_S0
I think parents must give children money,but not too much.	I_S0
it is can cultivate your children how to spend money,it is a very important skill.	I_S0
This idea can  make children independent,they will know manage theirself,make you children grow up.	I_S0
But if you children don't good at control himself,and he always spend money really fast,you must stop give him money or give a little.	I_S0
And teach him.	I_S0
If he don't listean to you,you shuold send your children to yangyonxin ,he is very sharp doctor,he can control thunder to cure your children.	I_S0
I don't believe your children not change .	E_S0
 
In fact, I can't fully agree with such behavior like offering children money for grade.	S_T0
In a way, money may give enough power to children to study harder, but it also shows them that the reason you study for is money.	S_M1
It's not like a courage, but more like a trade.	B_S1
Although some parents can make their child reach better grades, but the purpose of the child gradually turns to be utilitarian.	E_S1
But in some other situation, I think offering money is better way to encourage children to learn.	S_M1
If a child hates study so badly but actually he is gifted in study, maybe the money can reduce the uncomfotable about the school work, and the boy may break through his mental barrier.	B_S0
My cousin used to be a lazy child who really hated his school life, and my uncle was fed up with it but couldn't do anything to change  this situation.	I_S0
I knew my cousin was a truly smart boy, and so eager to be independant from his parents.	I_S0
The idea that offering him money for each grade he get in school came out.	I_S0
I talked with my uncle and he said he would consider this approach.	I_S0
After a long absence, when I see my uncle again, he doesn't show any bad mood when the topic goes to the children's school marks.	I_S0
He is so happy to see my cousin to make such a big progress in the final exam.	I_S0
But I still tell him that money is not the peak my cousin should reach.	I_S0
And this approach can never be pernament.	I_S0
If he wants my cousin to achieve more than this, he should tell him the differences between the money and dream.	E_S0
In a word, money can be used as tool, but not a goal for child to reach.	S_C2
 
In the modern world , there is no parents who do not want their children to have a great job ,a highly-esteem status and a grand amount of family weath in the future .	S_T1
To accomplish these goals while the kids are still young ,parents need to render their kids to have better grades in the school.	S_T0
However ,some parents  use their business way to stmulate kids ,binding money with their grades.	S_M0
I cannot agree with this action.	S_S2
Firstly ,indeed ,the money based stimuli will effctively refine kids' study impulse .	S_M0
Kids have  very clear goals to pursue ,maybe something they want to buy .	B_S0
In the light of this ,they will absolutely become active and positive in their study and even assiduous.	I_S0
But what a kid will feel is only the appeal of money and materialism, not the calling of knowledge and want to explore deeper  into the thoery.	I_S0
The will jeopardise his habits and make him have a stereotype which nothing in the world is more important than money .	I_S0
What this will cause is dim and moneycentrism in his future.	E_S0
Secondly,if the kids get higher marks in the test ,they ask even for more money ,whether those parents will offer them is a question .	S_M0
In addition ,for those who do not have much budget to offer their kids money as long as they have  good results,parents will even induce economy problem within their family .	B_S1
And as long as they cease to provide their kids with "scholarship",their kids will lose momentum to study immediately for there is nothing worth them to purse anymore.	E_S1
Lastly,more money for kids is not neccassary  a good sign.	S_M0
Many kids in the school age cannnot control themselves and buy many infeorior goods such as rubbish food .	B_S1
If kids cannot control themselves well ,they may evevn fall into some problems such as somking or drinking due to they are rich.	E_S1
A kids with amount of money is even not safe as if bad guys know that someone carry much money which their parents give them and rob them.	S_S2
In a word ,parents offer their kids money is not a good idea at all due to future consideration ,study impluse and management problems .	B_C1
Hope parents   elicit the implicit interets in their kids and al  of them can have great lives after grown up.	E_C1
 
As the development of the society, more and more people began to question the traditional lifestyle.	B_I0
Some people still advocate the traditional lifestyle--- work five days a week for short hours because it has through the test of time; other people argue that work only three days a weekfor long hours is more effective.	E_I0
However, I strongly believe that the traditional lifestyle is better, here are the reasons.	S_T0
Firstly, working for longer hours may increase health problems, and illness of course makes people painful and less enjoyable.	S_M1
Working for long hours may mean sleep later and get up earlier which against our biology clock.	B_S0
There is an old chinese saying: get up early and go to sleep early makes a man healthy.	I_S0
The only thing this disorder lifestyle can do is to make us more tired, sleepy and less effective.	I_S0
I am a very good example of this.	I_S0
When I was going to finish my primary school, I decide to study harder.	I_S0
I changed my bedtime and rising time.	I_S0
I went to sleep later and got up earlier.	I_S0
As a result to my new living habit, my grade decreased---I am too tired to focus my attention on the subject, the only thing I wanted to do was just sleeping.	I_S0
And my immune system became to be more feeble.	I_S0
The study is like that and the work is of the same principle.	I_S0
And without a good healtth, you almost cannot do anything!	I_S0
Anything you do is mysterable In conclusion, work five days a week for shorter time leads to a heathier life and makes people more effective.	E_S0
Admittedly, working for longer hours can achieve longer recreation period.	S_M1
But, we can also have a rest during summer and winter vovation!	S_S2
All in all, it is less satisfy to have a job where you work only three days a week for long hours than to have a job wher	O
we work five days a week for shorter hours	O
 
In such a high technology cutting edge of the new era and society, it is not hard for us to find that many parts of the society are changing, and the changes of the whole society needs someone to make decisions.	S_I0
Now some of people would hold that it must be some experienced people or some elder professors to make significant decisions.	S_T1
However, the decisions which come from young people today cannot be omitted.	S_T0
Few things could be more risky and terrible than having nobody to make decision to the society.	S_M1
So we have a lot of elder or experienced people to have the qualification to decide whether to carry out a new plan or idea.	B_S0
Just like in astronomy areas, we can search on the internet that most of enormous aircrafts or some gigantic rockets are invented by a lot of old experienced professors.	I_S0
What will happen if we don't have these people's advice and decisions?	I_S0
What we will see if we haven't these people except just useless dreaming about the outer space?	E_S0
There is no deny that the decisions comes from elder people sometimes are really crutial for the development of the whole society.	S_M1
The young generation, however, is also core for the decisions which could determine the future society.	B_S0
All of us should know these genius men, Zuckerberg, who invented the biggist interaction application in such a young age.	I_S0
Jack Ma, who build up the online shopping in China from nothing and no supporters when he is in a young age.	I_S0
These are all the decisions from themselves when they were in a tough hesitating period.	I_S0
Above these, there is no reason for us to object that young people today have few influences on the important decisions that determine the future society.	E_S0
In conclution, although	S_S2
 
In this highly competitive world, we always want to represent our ideas to others, then we have a way to spred them out loud: the advertisement.	B_I0
When we mention the ad, people always realize one thing, that is the whether we could 100 percent to believe the advertisement products.	I_I0
Nowadays, there is an increasing number of people holds that the function of ads products should not be trusted because they are always overly boasted and we cannot see what products really like.	I_I0
But they are not always just boasting all the time, ads have their own advantages sometime.	E_I0
Ads sometime have ingredient of boasting, which means that ads can make some goods seem much better than they really are.	S_M2
For instance, there was a famous brand of mineral water, Nongfu Spring, which was the most popular water in China onece.	B_S0
Their ad goes like some people annoucing that how safe and well water they have and a man drinking Nongfu Spring, then have a expression which looks like he is really enjoying this water, and he says 'Nongfu Spring is a little sweet'.	I_S0
This maybe something new for people during years ago, this is because people have never seen that kind of ads before.	I_S0
Then all the people wanted to try that water, but unfortunately, they cannot feel a little sweet at all.	I_S0
And few years ago, there was a huge event came: the government inspect the quality of the water, it said that Nongfu Spring was not on the safe water's degree, and there were some harmful ingredients in it.	I_S0
So this just conveys that ads could make products better than they really are, sometime can even judge bad to good.	E_S0
Admittedly, ads could make products seems much better than the real thing, but we should know that all the people in the world have the same flavor.	B_C0
It is about our ways of thinking, perspective, and sense of one thing.	I_C0
We cannot say whether one product bad or great, all of us have our own feelings, just like cars, watches, even some neck chains, we cannot blame ads just because we don't like them, this is just our own opinion to one object, not the ads' problem.	E_C0
 
Is it true for teachers to make the social or political views to students in classroom?	B_I0
Can this behavior influence the learning of the students?	E_I0
As a middle school student, from my perspective, I definitely thinks that it is not a good choice for the teachers to disseminate some political points in the classroom, since the students will distract from the views and be influenced by these views.	S_T1
On the one hand, the redundant political points render the grades of students decreasing.	S_M1
To be more convincible, these social views are not related to the academic knowledge in class.	B_S0
As a result, the behavior that disseminating these information in class is same as the behavior that wasting time in class, so our scores will decrease.	I_S0
Consider myself for instance.	I_S0
Last year, I joined a intreset-oriented class about the chemical, since I wanted to learn more extra knowledge as a remedy for the absenteeism last semester.	I_S0
However, our chemical teacher Lee told us his points about the these-days news, some policy of out country and so on every day.	I_S0
We wasted large amounts of time in the class, and finally I got a low scores.	I_S0
So obviously, these views that are not related to the class waste much of time and they are not good for our study.	E_S0
On the other hand, the redundant political points influence our own opinions.	S_M1
To be more specific, every one has different opinions in one thing, since every thing has many angles.	B_S0
However, if the teachers-- which are the symbol of the power in schools-- share their own opinion to everybody, large amounts of people will be influenced by their, just since all of us beileve the teacher in our subconsciousness.	I_S0
Take myself for instance again.	I_S0
7 years ago, I was a primary school students.	I_S0
At that time, our countries had the conflict with the Japan, and then some young people in my city used some stick to damaged the production likes the car or some other untensil that made in Japan.	E_S0
However, our teacher tolds us this is a good behavior, since it can	O
 
I think this is not a good idea.	S_T0
And it even is not a proper way in educating children.	S_T1
I have three reasons support myself.	S_T0
First,some children wil pruduce a kind of dependency if their parents continue giving them money by judge theri mark.	S_M0
That makes children only concentrate on study,because they can do many things they want only by working hard in schol.	B_S0
However,if one day,parents do not want to give the money to their chilren,the chilren would be angry and can not understand why they cant get money by getting good marks.	I_S0
In social survival,have good marks in not enough to earn money.	I_S0
Children can not understand the true values.	E_S0
In addition,money as a kind of award of getting good grades in study.	S_M0
Children maybe define money,is the whole meaning of study.	B_S0
Thererfore,children can not feel the joy of learning,they can not be active in learning if there is no award.	I_S0
In facts,money is not the purpose of study.	I_S0
The joy of new discovery,get the answer of the hard problem.	I_S0
These are the real goal of study.	I_S0
So it will let the children can not see the every adventages of study,they can hardly feel the every aspects uses by study.	E_S0
At last,many children do not know how to use the money in true ways.	S_M0
because parents don know where the money going,this ma	O
 
With the development of our society, schools provide various deciplines for students in order to improve their knowlege and enhance competitive power.	S_I0
From my perspective, taking history courses brings students a lot of benefits, therefore, I agree with the statement that all university students should take history course no matter what their major is.	S_T0
To begin with, taking history courses enlarge the depth of thinking of students, which is good for them in the future.	S_M1
In the history classes, we learn that Martin Luther King struggled for eliminating racial discrimination and he made a famous speech of 'I have a dream'.	B_S0
In fact, this speech is really a remarkable event in the history which helps us to learn the bravey and ambition of Martin Luther King.	I_S0
If students don't take history courses, they will never know it and aware of the importance of equality among humans.	I_S0
Therefore, history courses indeed teachs students a profound truth.	E_S0
Additionally, students who take hostory classes have more advantages in the fierce competition.	S_M1
Due to the fact that they study more than one decipline, they tend to more knowledgeable than others.	B_S0
As a matter of fact, the human resource of big company prefers to hire employees who are versatile of several fileds.	I_S0
For example, my aunt works in human resources.	I_S0
Every time she interview graduats, she are willing to select out resumes which mention double degree.	E_S0
Because she thinks that those have rich knowlegde can deal with problems through various	O
 
Some parents offer money to their chirdren when their chirdren gain a high score in school.	S_I0
I think it is not a good idea for parents and children.	B_T0
Let me introduce my opinion to you in detail.	E_T0
First of all, children study for themselves,but not for money.	S_M2
If parents use this kind of method to encourage children to study, children may lose their right direction for studing.	B_S0
Once they break away their parents, they will not find the reason to do hard.	I_S0
Secondly, it is bad for children's value conception system.	I_S0
When children receive money though study, they may think study can only get money, and ignore the deep meanings of knowledge.	I_S0
This can make children forget the thue meaning of study.	I_S0
Thirdly, it is a kind of preassure for children.	I_S0
Chirdren may think that he or she will not have money if they don't study hard.	I_S0
Last but not least, it is also bad for the relation between children and parents.	I_S0
This kind of idea can make children and parents feel not well because the relation is contacted by money.	E_S0
In short, it is a pretty bad idea for parents to do this to encourage their children to study.	B_C1
Study for knowledge but not for money.	E_C1
 
I don't think it is not a good idea that parents offer their school-age childern money for each high grade (mark) they get in school.	B_T1
There are some reasons as follows: First of all, from my perspective, there are lots of methods for parents to encourage their childern to study, however, if money get involved in it, the meaning of encouragement will be changed.	I_T1
Childern might regard getting good grades as a way to get money so that education will no more be what it should be.	E_T1
Secondly, childern perhaps don't have such ability to manage their money.	S_M2
As for them, the money offerde by parents to	O
 
Education is a hot topic up until now because education is very important in one's life, especially for young children who are in their golden age.	S_T0
As for the attention of parents, do they are more involved in their children's education than were parents in the past?	S_T1
From my perspective, I will say yes.	B_T0
Because they think education more important than before and they have more time to care their children's study.	E_T0
First, people take education more importantly than did they in the past.	S_M1
The knowledge and skills are very important for a current person.	B_S0
They rely on what they learned to earn their lives and get established in society.	I_S0
Take  my young sister for an example, my mother treats her strictly in her study.	I_S0
My sister must get up early in the morning to have a reading and do her homework before playing.	I_S0
My mother care my sister's every exam performance.	I_S0
When in summer break, my sister has to attend so many interest classes, like piano class, painting class and so on.	I_S0
However, when I was young, my mother did not care my study at all because She thought I can also have a good life without knowledge.	E_S0
Besides, parents have more time to put on children's study.	S_M1
With the development of the society, people's life become better and better.	B_S0
They begin to enjoy their lives not only care for their bread.	I_S0
The parents have more time to take care of their children's study.	I_S0
For instance, my uncle never cared my niece's study in the past when she was young.	E_S0
 
Nowadays, with getting a high score in a final exam, some children will be rewarded some money wich enable them determine how to use.	B_T1
Imagine the circumstance that two kids both get the asset but one of them is just 6 years old and the other will be an adult soon after, what would you think of their behavior?	I_T1
Obviously, this problem should be treated distinctively under different situations.	E_T1
Firstly, the rewarded money enable mature kid to foster their asset management facility.	S_M1
However, the kid need to learn how to spend money on things that benefit themselves.	B_S0
Despite the fact that children always lack of self-control right now, with their age growing, how to manage their money has been more and more crucial for them.	I_S0
In contrast, this skill is not rapidly necessary for young people who could be rewarded by a specific thing like a pair of shoes instead of money.	E_S0
Scondly, the kids who is mature enough would understand what the rewarded money means, and they will be stimulated to study harder even than before, which would not happend on the young kid because of their simple thinking.	S_M1
It is more possible for young kids to regard the asset as a signal that the money can be used unlimited rather than a award, which may be dangerous for their growth in the future.	S_S2
Thirdly, the asset permit mature kids to enhance their horizon by using on their hobby, but the young kid would not do that although they also have their own hobby.	S_C2
 
With the development of the world, many people have a better life than before, their can buy what their want to buy, in the past a lot of people can,t find a job ,so there,s a lot of stress in their lives.	B_T1
But nowadays people to find job is more easy than before ,  they will be able to live a better life.	I_T1
So l disagree the people are lees happy or less satisfied than the before.	E_T1
In the pass the some people are it,s hard to get a job , so they were worry about his life, because	O
 
Giving money as reward of high grades to school-aged children has became a wide-spread convention.	B_I0
Nowadays,more and more people choose money as encouragement for their children.	I_I0
This phenomenon has rised a debate about is it a good idea to do it?	E_I0
Different people may have different attitude towards it.	S_T0
According to my opnion,it is a good idea to use money as reward for children got good grades.	S_T1
First,giving money as a reward will makes children feel the love of the family.	S_M1
how to reward a children with good grades is a big problem for a lot of families.	B_S0
But if you give money as reward which is similiar to the scholarship in university, the problem will completely solved.	I_S0
The children will feel the love of his family and will not feel upset for no rewards.	I_S0
For example,my sister just got her scholarship in her university last semester.	I_S0
In order to encourage her, her parents have thought about a lot of ideas.	I_S0
But finally,they choose to reaward her with the money which is the most useful things for her.	I_S0
And my sister feel very proud when she talked about it with her roommates and friends,she felt that she has a very wonderful parents.	E_S0
Second,this reward will make students become more agressive and will pay more attention to study.	S_M1
Because the students also have something that they want to buy,so they will try their best to get the money.	B_S0
And in order to meet the standerd that their parents set,they need to be more intelligent and study hard.	I_S0
Taking my experience as an examople.	I_S0
When I was in the primary school,I was eager to buy a book in the bookstore.	I_S0
But my grandparents said that I had to get good grades to get extra money to use.	I_S0
After that,I experienced one of my most hardworking time in my life.	I_S0
Finally,I got a very good grade and got the reward that my grandparents have promised before.	I_S0
This story tought me that the reward will definitely make people struggle for.	I_S0
And it can prove my opinion.	E_S0
Third,this reward might makes children become greedy.	B_C0
If we stree more about the money we give to our children, we will make our children becom greedy and which may be bad for their adult living.	I_C0
For example,one of my roommate has this kind of tradition when he was young,he definitely motivated by this and got good grades when he was young.	I_C0
But this also lead to some bad habits which makes him become a mean person.	I_C0
But if we can make good way to do the reward,I believe that it still ha m We can see from the discussion above that offering money to the children as reward may not be a completely perfect things but it has more good benefits that the bad influences.	I_C0
So I would like to say that the idea to reward money to school-aged children is not a bad idea.	E_C0
 
I disagree with the statement that "It is better to relax by watching a movie a or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise", I will show my reasons below from three aspects.	S_I0
First of all, we should figure out why we need relax.	S_M1
Some people want to be happy through a long time of studying or working, others hold the opinion that a break from working can make contributions to their health after hardwork.	B_S0
Whichever the reason is, I'd like to point out that physical exercise is the most important issue.	I_S0
physical exercise is of vital important whether you like it.	I_S0
As the chairman Mao once said that"Your health is your life", without a health body, we can do nothing.	I_S0
In other words, including  watching movies or reading books.	E_S0
The second reason laies on the fact that doing  physical exercise can also make your feel relaxed.	S_M1
Taking running as an example, you can admire the landscape throughout the journey when you running and this kind of activities bring relaxtion not less than watching movies or reading books.	B_S1
What we should do is try to find out the beauty of the nature and fall in love with it.	E_S1
Last but not the least, when you choose to relax by watching movies or reading books.	S_C2
You can relax your soul, which seems like a good choice.	B_S0
However, when you do sports outdoors, you can relax both mentality and physical because you can communicate with your friends through sports like basketball, football and so on.	I_S0
During the period of practiscing  sports, you feel good about teamwork, friendship and unity, which do good to your	E_S0
 
Have you ever seen that many cars are driving on the street and cause the traffic jam?	B_I0
In this society, many people believe that there will be more cars in the future because many people will be rich and able to purchase a car.	E_I0
However, when it comes to the statement thet in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use in the future, I strongly agree.	B_T0
There are three explanation that can hele me to demostrate this opinion.	E_T0
First of all, I believe that the public transportation will be well improved in twenty tears later.	S_M1
With the technology improved, the transprotation must follow the technology level and be better and better.	B_S0
For example, in the last twenty years, individuals were riding the cycle or just walking to the office.	I_S0
Only the person which was really rich can drove the car to go to the work.	I_S0
Instead, nowadays, most of the people afford to get a car, even mid-level also can buy a car without borrow some money.	I_S0
But with more and more people are able to buy cars, the traffic will be really croweded.	I_S0
If the public transprotations are well improved that can even be faster than the privite cars.	I_S0
There will be many people prefer to choise public transportantion to go to the office.	I_S0
Then the person who use the privite car will reduce.	E_S0
Furthermore, I think the environmental pollution must be more better than today.	S_M1
Therefore, the goverment must use some scheme to decrease the origin of the pollution.	B_S0
For instance, the most of the reason that cause the environmental pollution is that there are more and more cars driving in the street.	I_S0
And the gas which is emissed by cars will cause the air be more and more dirty.	I_S0
Then the goverment must do some scheme such as who use the public transportantion or just walk when they go to another place will give them some prizes or glorise.	I_S0
The residents must be glad to get the prize and glory.	I_S0
Then the car population will decrease.	E_S0
Finally, I beliv	S_S2
 
What will you do when you really want to have a relaxing afternoon?	S_I0
Some people prefer doing physical exercise to have relax,while I personally believe that when it comes to relax,watching a movie or reading a book is more effective than doing exercise since the disadvantages of watching movies or reading a book are overwhelmed by the enourmous merits.	S_T1
Initially,I can select whatever I want to watch when I am reading or watching TV.	S_M1
To be honest,the sense of freedom really helps a lot when you are having relax.	B_S1
And by watching my favorite sci-fi movies or choose a romance novel to read,I can have a free afternoon and time run away swiftly.	E_S1
Additionally,I can be captured easily by the spectacular plots and neglect the fact that a couple of hours just flies away.	S_M1
The more dramatic the plot is,the easier you can be enchanted with it,which also helps you to have a relaxing time and lower the sense of time.	S_S2
Whereas,when you are having relax by doing physical exercise,you will get tired easily,which strengthens your sense of how fast the time flows away	O
 
In my opinion,doing physical exercise is a better way to relax.	S_T0
First,you can get some friends when doing exercise who have common language with you.	S_T1
For example,I like playing badminton as relaxing and I made many friends when I played.	B_S0
Now we have a settled time and settled persons to play badminton and we can get progress and have fun each time.	I_S0
If you choose reading a book or watching a movie,you were not able to make so many friends who could aways have fun with you.	E_S0
Second,doing physical exercise is another way to help you study better.	S_M1
As we all know,after playing sports,people will study better because they brain will get more excited and active.	B_S0
However,if you reading or watching a movie between two periods time of studying,you can feel more tired other than relaxed.	I_S0
Every time after I played badminton for several hour,I would be gald to study.	I_S0
But every time after reading I would feel a little weary;every time after watching a movie I wouldn't be going to study any longer.	E_S0
Third,doing physical exercise can protect you eyes.	S_M1
Long pieriod time of studying can make our eyes uncomfortable.	B_S0
Reading and watching movies,whatever we choose to relax won't make our eyes relaxed but more tired.	I_S0
Only doing sports can protect our eyes especially playing ping-pang and other small ball.	I_S0
I believe everyone dislikes wearing glasses.	E_S0
"Health is the most important thing."	B_C0
My father always tell me that and I never doubt the words.	I_C0
Without a nice body what can we do?	I_C0
Reading?	E_C0
Watching movies?	B_S0
Studying?	I_S0
All will be visonal.	E_S0
So doing physical exercese m	O
 
When it comes to this question,answers would be varied from person to person.	B_T0
And my choice is it is parents' duty to let children make mistakes and correct them on their own.	E_T0
Firstly,as an old saying goes,God helps those who help themselves.	S_M2
That is to say,kids need ordeal to strengthen themselves.	B_S0
Only when kids endure the mistakes,will them be durable on their ways to life.	I_S0
For instance,there is no method for infancy to breathe without suffering from the pain of smoking.	I_S0
It is the mistake,the pain that impart him the idea to open his mouth to devour the fresh air.	I_S0
Secondly,if kids always depend on his parents to point out his mistakes and help him correct it step by step,kids will fall into the individualism.	I_S0
That is a place,where he will cry for help whithout realizing the circumstance where he will be apart from parents one day.	I_S0
Moreover,he will lose chance to improvise his skills,become disinterested to persue his dream but to dialet his greed to rely on others.	I_S0
And there will be the day,when there is nobody for him to rely on.	I_S0
Thirdly,the merits of this mode that parents permit kids to overcome their mistakes are myraid.	I_S0
Not only their courage,but also the skill to deal with difficulties will be improved sharply.	I_S0
For example,there was once a lovely boy in a small town.	I_S0
He was used to relying on his father to make a living until the economy decession.	I_S0
His father lost all,even his life.	I_S0
As a result,the boy had to stand up,changing a sluggish boy into a deligent one ,who is engaged with all kinds of difficulties.	I_S0
Some are overwhelming,others are easy to be solved.	I_S0
The boy overlooked the risk chasing behind him,but strive to overcome them.	I_S0
Then,he became the abolishmentalism,the USA president.	E_S0
All of these things could be drawed into one conclusion that children badly need to make mistakes and overcome them.	B_C1
Only in this mean,will them be independent and be sophisticted about the mistakes in society.	E_C1
 
Entertainer and sports are more and more important in our daliy life, and it become a measure to inllestrate people's daliy life.	S_T0
Therefore, social begin to measure wheather to offer more privacy than they have now.	S_T1
More privacy could give they more encourage to get better greads, but it will break social belance now.	B_T0
For my opinion, I think it is better choice to give privacy to them.	E_T0
As for athletes, giving privacy could let social concern to sports.	S_M0
It is a good way to make more people to take part in the sports team and get healthy.	B_S0
More people do that more reward the social will recive.	I_S0
People will exercise during the sports, then they will get better body in study and work.	I_S0
My friend find the volleyball player was famous, and he take part in the volleyball club in the school.	I_S0
After that his body become stronger than before.	E_S0
For the entertainers, it is a better way to spread the skill to social.	S_M0
By doing this the entertainers will feel better and bring more enjoyable play to people.	B_S1
Therefore, the entertainers will get better future.	E_S1
And some of the entertainers whoes technology is at the edge of cliff.	S_M0
By giving privacy, more people will know it and more people will be interesting in it.	B_S1
Then the skill will have inheritors, they will not faced with disapperance.	E_S1
In that case, I think it was better to pay more resorce on them.	B_C1
It not only benifit for now but future.	E_C1
 
As far as I am concerned, I agree the measure the parents take to motivate their school-age children getting higher grade.	B_T1
Offering their children money has two advantages from my oppion.	E_T1
First of all, it is efficient for child to motivate themsevles to get higher grades.	S_M1
As for me, I have been praised by the measure and because of that present I was more and more interested in study.	B_S0
I still remember that day in which I got an A in an exam.	I_S0
Back home, I told my mother the scole as usual.	I_S0
To my surprise, my mother gave me 10 yuan as present!	I_S0
Although it was only the 10 yuan, it had a different meaning in my mind and was valuable for me because it means I was be recognized by others.	I_S0
Therefore, I was harder than before and recently became an undergraduate in my ideal university.	E_S0
Second, offering money as a pressent is a simple way for parents to praise their children.	S_M1
If not using money, some parents will buy other gifts for their children which may be not liked by their children and make themselves and their children unhappy.	B_S0
Take my friend's experience as an example.	I_S0
My friend is really good at math and her grades are A every time.	I_S0
Her parents will buy her a nice gift.	I_S0
However, I sometimes would see her unhappy.	I_S0
on an opportunity I asked why she is not happy even if she had an A, and she told me that her parents always did not know what she really want and often bought something she dislikes or boring for her.	I_S0
However, she had never enough money to buy something she likes.	I_S0
Thus, I think for some parents offering money is a good way satisfying both parents'need and children's need.	E_S0
As a word, I agree the measure that suggest some parents offer their children money for their high mark, which can motivate their children to get higher marks and be a good way to meet the children's need.	B_C1
It is a really excellent idea.	E_C1
 
I'm afraid that I don't agree with the parents' behaviours.	S_T1
Here's my reason.	B_S0
First of all, school-age children may usually have such a doubt "why should I learn this boring things and it seems they will never be used in my life again".	I_S0
By giving them money as a reward, these parents give them an answer:" learning these things is for a high grade".	I_S0
The harm that gives the children such an thought is not clear, but it will gradually begin to work.	I_S0
It will make the children think that "knowledge is not important itself, what truely matters is a high mark" .	I_S0
In other words, what the children think highly of is not knowledge but a high mark that can be exchaged into money.	I_S0
So it will not be surprising that some children may cheat during exams because in their opinion of value, only the mark and the result is important, none of the other things, such as knowlegde, honestness or means of getting a good mark can be the same.	I_S0
Sadly, such a child may loss passion in the process.	I_S0
He may no longer cherish the hard working process with his schoolmates, what is actually the most meaning memory of our school life, he may no longer seem the fruit of hard working as a treasure, instead he may think it just a waste of time because it isn't that efficent.	I_S0
I can still remember when I was young, my mom treated me with the same way as the parents do.	I_S0
It works in some perspective that my grades increase at a high speed, however that make me a different kid as before.	I_S0
I thought grades are everything.	I_S0
I may laugh at my classmates who work hard but fail to do well in his remarks, and I only wanted to become friends with those who have good grades even if they were not kind persons and loved to trick on others.	I_S0
Points may be important, but it is important because it is a witness of our hard working.	I_S0
However, if the parents do so, points become the only important thing, low points by hard working means nothing, high points without hard working can still be a reason of awards and cheers.	I_S0
I think it is deadly harmful to a child's growth.	E_S0
 
As sayings goes, nobody can avoid making mistakes.	B_T1
It's unavoidable for people to make mistakes, especially for children who know little about this sophestic society.	E_T1
Children cannot make no mistakes in their youth and they shoud learn from their mistakes and be better in their later life.	S_T0
Parents play an important role in chidren's life.	S_M0
But it cannot be denied that they cannot do anything for their children.	B_S0
If they protect their children too much, children cannot realize that the society is not as simple as they thought.	I_S0
It will do harm to chidren to live in fantasy lifes.	I_S0
Princess White was protected too well by her father, so she was too easily to be cheated by bad woman.	I_S0
In the real life, there is no prince to save the poor girl in time and she will pay for her foolish.	E_S0
Some people insisted that parents will tell their children to behave correctly.	S_M0
What you listened is easily to be forgot, however, and what you experienced will remind you forever.	B_S0
When I was young, my father told me that people should be modest and never show off.	I_S0
I did not realize the importance of his words until I lose my final examination.	E_S0
Additionally, mistakes made by children tend to be easier to correct because they are accompanied by parents at most of time.	S_M0
An adult who has money or power, however, may do much harm to the society when he makes mistakes.	B_S1
If a child make mistakes and his/her parents educate him/her in time , he will learn from his own mistakes better.	E_S1
It' also do bet	O
 
So I agree with these parents.	S_T0
It's a good idea.	S_I0
In this way, I'd say it will be a good way to encourage their children to study hard and some other benefits.	S_T0
To start with, it's a good way to ecourage children study hard.	S_M2
The freedom is base on money, every children want to be more freedom too.	B_S0
So if they need money, this way can encourage them to study hard.	I_S0
And a good grade won't be a bad things, right?	I_S0
My litter brothers, as I know he won't be a student who can study harder then play.	I_S0
But his parents choose this way, and it make him to pay more attention to get a good grade.	E_S0
Then, money has an important position in our social	S_S2
 
With the advent of new technologies in this era of industry and machines, cars have become a major means for transportation in our life.	B_I0
Cars offer a wide variety of services and enhance our lifestyle.	I_I0
The question in here is that whether cars would be as much popular as it is today in twenty years.	E_I0
I agree with statement that cars will be less used in the future are my justifications.	S_T1
To begin with, new technologies will make people less likely to drive cars for transportation.	S_M1
With modern public transportation systems available almost anywhere, individuals would rather using a punlic transportation because of several important reasons.	B_S0
They are not only less expensive, but also more convenient.	I_S0
For instance, if one tends to travel with bus, he or she has to pay a samll amount of money for the ticket, which the cost is shared by all the people using the bus.	I_S0
Moreover, oublic transportation is more facile.	I_S0
Considering metro system, it is fast and effecient and could give you access to all sections of the city.	I_S0
In contrast, using car is expensive and frustrating, due to high traffic congestion in current large and populated cities.	I_S0
What is more, internet and social communicational systems provides us with a number of ways to contact others.	I_S0
Let us take a typical example to shed light to this point.	I_S0
Using internet, managers held tele-conferences or use video calls to do their bussiness.	I_S0
Furthermore, relatives and friends could keep more contact using social networks rather thantravelling a long distance using cars to visit each other.	E_S0
Besides the aforementioned reason, environmental issues lead to less car utilization.	S_M1
Everyone is aware of the common worldwide problems such as air pollution, global warmin, depletion of oil and gas reservories and loss of animal habitats.	B_S0
The more the cars are used and fuel is burned, the more air pollution and its concomitant hazards would be.	I_S0
Hence, due to bothe the people's awareness of the imminent dangers and governmental legislation and fiscal, fewer cars will be used in twenty years.	I_S0
What is more,  energy crisis is another prominent reason leading to less use of cars.	I_S0
Scientists forecast that the world oil and gas reservoirs will be depleted in less than a century if we keep up this high rate of oil production and fuel usage.	I_S0
As a rule, these examples clearly illustrate the previously mentioned fact.	E_S0
All in all, among the prominent reasons in support of the topic.	B_C0
I think that technologies and environmental problems are the major reasons.	I_C0
I substantiate the fact that there will be fewer cars in use than there today.	E_C0
 
After entering the college or university, students may be busy with both their academic courses and their part-time activities like joining the clubs and running the organizations.	B_T1
Aa they are struggled in arrranging their schedules, the issue of whether these activities can be as beneficial as the their acadamic courses rises in their mind.	I_T1
Some people may think the activities can be more interesting and improve their abilities in some ways.	I_T1
However, from my piont of view the acadamic courses are still more  improtant.	E_T1
Though the activities takes a large part of students' life in the university, the main purpose of students to join in the university should be learning the necessity skills they required in the future and  get their degree.	S_M2
Usually the club activities can only serve as a way for the students to boardcast their vision and inspires their interests.	B_S0
In other words, they serve as an assitence to the students' studies and does not play the main role in increasing students abilities.	I_S0
After all, reading Shakespeare's books can be great but it does not help you with getting a engineering degree.	E_S0
What's more, the acadamic courses can be more beneficial for the students because they truely exercise the ability of student.	S_C2
Although it has been argued by many people that club activities improves students' social skills through the communication and helps them get more friends, acadamic courses' works improve students's hard skills such as learning how to be independent, how to get along with others in the time work.	S_S2
 
I agree with it is better to relax by watching movie or reading books than relax by doing physical exercise.	B_T0
In our life,more and more people should relaxthemselves	E_T0
Watching movies or reading books can make us feel more relax because when we doing these ,we should not use our bodies and we don't feel tried.	S_M1
we will lose ourselves in movies or books then we can feel real relax.	S_S2
Physical exercise also can make people relax,but it will make people feel tried, because it should people use their bodies.	S_M1
My English is poor and I don't like it at all.	B_S2
Above all,relax by watching movies or read books is better than doing physical exercise.	E_S2
 
I had read a passage from a magazine.	B_I0
That passage talks about what the society, the world will be in the future.	I_I0
It says because of the devolpment of the economic and the technolog, the world will smaller and smaller.	I_I0
When I look around surrundings, I can watch a movie which is produced in Japan, and can hold a starbucks came from the U.S.A, I believe it is turth that the world is being smaller and bettering.	I_I0
But I disagree with the statement in the second part of this passage that young people today have no influence on the important decisions that determine the future of society as a whole.	E_I0
On the countrary, I think today's young people are more powerful than before that can influence on the important decisions of the society' future.	S_T0
The society is becoming smaller than smaller, which means young people have more chance to connect with the world they did't konw.	S_M2
The wealth and the advanced technical they handing now is the most powerful vessel for them to hit the wall between adults and	O
 
The compitition between students is more and more constractive, and parents want children to have good grades in what ever ways.	S_I0
In my views, I supports some parents' plan that offer the school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.	S_T0
First of all, it can encourage students to work hard and earn more money for what they want, if the higher mark student get, the more money they can get from their parents.	S_M1
With the development of technology, there are so many goods that children like to buy, such as soft toy, small cars, even some electronic products, and money can use to buy them.	B_S0
If they want to have toys, they should plan that how they should try their best to get a good grade.	I_S0
This kind of encouragement have enough ability for children to study, so that children can not only study for a sum of konwledge, but also help them to achive their order.	E_S0
Secondly, after parents give them money, children can improve their anility of managing money.	S_M1
When theny work so hark to earn money, they will konw how diffcult to get money, so they may plan carefully to spend the money and study how to use and save money.	B_S0
For example, a girl, Sunny, find a beautiful doll when hanging out, and she know the doll need to pay $35.	I_S0
She started to read more book, and have independent study before teacher teaching the knowledge, even getting up late.	I_S0
Finally, she get A grade on the mid-exam, and then, her parents give her $50 to encourage her.	I_S0
This happy girl go to buy the doll, and she finds when she save the money to bank, she can have more mony in the future.	I_S0
It is the first step for children to learn about the ecnonmy which can be an important skill.	E_S0
All in all, it is benificial for children that their parents plan to offer the school-age children money for each high grade they get in school because it can encourage them to study hard, and develop their ability of managing money and planning.	B_C1
Although some people think it may lead children to loss the pure opinion for studing, it can be solve easily, if parent teachthem at first.	E_C1
 
Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among student: the student should work with a group or work by themselves can learn much more effectively.	B_I0
Opinions vary from person to person, some claim that to work alone is the best way.	E_I0
However, contrary to their view comes my perspective that to work together is the best solution.	S_T1
Firstly, to work in a group can easily to get answer, to be more specific, when we work with our teammates, than if we get any queastion, we can just ask to them and they will teach us patiently.	S_M1
Because we are a group, so we must study together than we can win in the competition.	B_S0
On the contrary, if we work alone, when we get some question, may be the teacher is absent and when we want ask to other classmate, they will teach us well, because they are have a compete with us.	I_S0
For example, there is a math competition in our school, and the rule is random team formation, like you can work in a group and work alone.	I_S0
So i choose to work in a three people's team.	I_S0
Than in the end, all the winner is group, and the people who work alone all get the lower score.	E_S0
Secondly, to work together can exercise our skills.	S_M1
To be more specific, to work in a group is  not only can study the acknowledge, we also can learn how to talk with other people in a group and how to maintain the relationship between all the teammates.	B_S0
On the contrary, when we work alone, is ture that may be we can improve our study level, but we will get bad community in the future, so we will get many trouble.	I_S0
For example, when i was in the middle school, if school make any activity that need student to make a team to work, i will be the leader in the team, because almost student they do not know what kinds of people should they find to make a team, so i will make the same type of students to be a team, than they will make their energy to be the max.	I_S0
So when i was work in a company, my skill was highlight in the company, so my boss like me very much, than my level is also growing very quickly.	E_S0
 
Recently, some parents offer their children money for high mark they get in school, which set off a heated discussion.	B_I0
Some people argue that it is a good idea.	I_I0
On one hand, it can encourage children to study harder and do better in their academics, which will benifit their children profoundly.	E_I0
On the other hand, it can foster students' sense of economic, that is, teach their children the concept of finance from an early age.	S_T0
What's more, they can also tell their children an important lesson that any effort can be paid off.	B_S1
It just like a healthy circulation that impel student to pursue their dream.	E_S1
However, others hold the definitely opposite opinion.	S_M2
In their view, the purpose of study should be pure.	B_S0
It just the love towards knowledge and their dream.	I_S0
It should not be added to too much money factors and make study too utilitarian.	E_S0
From my perspective, this is a good way to push us to go on and be more energetic.	S_C2
It just like an aim for a short time, so that we can concentrate our attention and try our best to realize our dream.	B_S1
However, it is not necessary the money, we can change the form of reward, such as a book, a chance to travel or just some presents.	E_S1
In this way, not only can students  have the motivation to study, but also they will not contact with money too er	O
 
In recent decades, as high grades standing for a conscience learning attitude and an advancement in academics, great significance has been attached to the marks that school-age children get in school.	B_I0
Consequently, many parents have developed a money-rewarding method to encourage their children to gain achievement in academic performances.	E_I0
From my perspective, this is not a good method, because it migh cause many side effects such as bad spending habits, focusing on monetary things rather than academic issues and so on.	S_T0
First of all, money is always related to materialism and academic is something spritual.	S_M1
An equal can never be drawn between two different categories.	B_S0
Encouraging the children by rewarding money for hign mark might probably led to the wrong opinion.	I_S0
Children might think that everything in academics is money-related because this is the only motivation for them to be better involved in learing.	I_S0
The wrong pattern will inevitably cause failure because the real reaserchers and scientists are those who have a intense interest in the fields that they are working on and money won't bring the authentic interest in learning.	E_S0
Nevertheless, the money-rewarding pattern for school age children might cause wrong spending habits.	S_M1
Children in that age are too naive and they have no idea how to deal with the money they have been awarded.	B_S0
As we all know, children are not sensible and they purchase any thing they want if it is affordable.	I_S0
Under this circumstances, many wrong choices will be made.	I_S0
If things continue in this way, they will have a hard time changing this troublesome habit when they grow up.	I_S0
This is absolutely what we don't want to see in the future.	E_S0
To, summarize, the money-rewarding pattern does more harm than good, consequently it is totally avoidable, there are many other ways to encourage the children to learn better.	S_C2
 
With the deveiopment of science and economy, the job hunting markets are require more for people who get invloved in.	S_T1
As a result, it gets harder and harder for people to get a satisfied job.	B_T0
Some people hold a view that they would like to catch a secure job right now rather than wait for a job more better.	I_T0
However, I totally disagree with this opinion.	E_T0
To begin with, some companies especially large companies would like to inform the emploee just before the deadline, and due to this many people would lost a good job without their patience.	S_M1
Take my cousin for example, last year after he gradulate from university, he applied for some positions and took some auditions.	B_S0
Lucklily, he receives some offers which were not very good and big companies he applied for neither have a responce.	I_S0
He worried and feeled down about himselves, right before he planed to back to school for futher study, offers of large companies came one by one.	I_S0
So, it is not a good way to get secure job withour waiting for a better one.	E_S0
What is more, a perpon with high knowledge and abilities would not receice a job easily.	S_M1
Since they are confident with themselves, they believe that a better one is on the way.	B_S0
For instance, my friend Lily, who was the best talent student when she at school.	I_S0
After graduation, many companies and association are wanting her.	I_S0
But the only one she was interested in is Apple Company, she was the big fan of Steven Jobs and she went to the company as volunteers when she was a senior.	I_S0
However, Apple would not give her an offer.	I_S0
She would not feel any worried as she was sure about herself, in fact, the company gave her the offer at end.	I_S0
Great people would not going to make themselves suffer from injustice, they would like to wait for the best.	E_S0
In a nutshell, I have to say that people are not always receive the one more sucure, on the contrary, they are more willing to wait for the better job not only because they want to prove themselves but also the best is the last.	S_C2
 
I do not think this is a good idea.	S_T1
The first reason is that children need to be responsible for themselves.	B_S0
If they acheive every task they are originally supposed to accomplish, they might be thinking that they do it for others instead of thermselves, which is absolutely inappropriate.	I_S0
Every person in our society has duties, including children.	I_S0
Children's duty is to study hard and earn good marks, they shouldn't be rewarded with money just because they do the things they should do.	I_S0
If every policeman helps the public only in order to get money, how awful the world will be!	I_S0
Assume that a lady's purse is stolen, she calls the police for help and the police tell her that they won't help catch the theif unless she pays.	I_S0
Can you imagine this situation?	I_S0
Similarly, a boy gets an A on English 11 on his report card, his parents reward him amount of money.	I_S0
The boy tells his parents that he will not try his best to get an A  again unless they offer money again.	I_S0
Money is essential in our society, but that doesn't mean people do everything in order to get money.	I_S0
Responsibilities can't be abandoned, the police should offer people help and the boy should get high grade.	I_S0
They should do what they are expected to do without charging.	I_S0
The second reason is that children will compare and contrast the amout of money their parents offer in school.	I_S0
The school needs to provide a well-established studying environment for students.	I_S0
Students can not focus on the amount of money they receive all the time and use it as a weapon to laugh at the students that do not possess a rich family backgroud.	I_S0
The poor students might be harmed and hope to  and get the same treatments as the rich students.	I_S0
They probably accuse their parents of not being rich and try their best to improve their school status.	I_S0
Anyway, this atmosphere really harm all the students.	I_S0
It is mostly because of parents reward money for high marks.	E_S0
 
For the question that weather parents offer their school-age childrenmoney for each high grade they get in school.	S_I0
I think it is not a good idea.	B_T1
As we all know,some money is important and nescessary for school-age children to do something they want,which help children grow up freely.	I_T1
But,when it comes to the grade they got in school,the money will not used freely anymore.	E_T1
And this will limit children's imagination and freedom.	B_S0
In this way,the money will lose its nature meaning and get useless.	I_S0
Then children will only get high grade just for their more money.	I_S0
This is really bad for children's growing.	I_S0
Children study just for profit.	I_S0
And they lose their imagination and children-nature.	I_S0
When they grow up,they will never do something without profit and become someone with no human-nature and feelings.	I_S0
Then the study is useless,or even more,gets dangerous.	I_S0
So this idea is really bad for children's growing.	E_S0
Just imagine that,we give children money purly,then they can grow freely and become a happy and cute one.	S_M2
After that we can teach them to study hard and tell them the ture meaning of that,which is study is just for study and study makes you happy.	B_S0
That's enough.	I_S0
The children will grow up to the one who loves studying with imaginatin and pure heart.	I_S0
That's really nice.	E_S0
 
As we can see, thanks to rapidly developing economy and society, more and more people have their own cars and are willing to travel by cars instead of public transpotation.	S_T0
However, our environmental issues become more and more serious meanwhile, since the carbon dioxide from car emission exacerbate the greenhouse effect.	B_T1
People begin to be aware of this and to take actions these years, so I think cars will be used less in 20 years.	E_T1
Firstly, our public transpotation, such as subways and bueses, will be improved greatly so that people can go to anywhere at anytime they want conveniently.	S_M2
Without the need of parking cars, this may be the best choice to go to destinations especially downtown areas.	B_S0
SecondlLast but not least, people's environmental awareness will be also raised.	I_S0
Today, someone may not walk there but choose to drive a car even for shorter distances.	I_S0
In the future, some healthy ways, like walking or riding bikes will be their first selection.	I_S0
People will not only take more attention to their physical health, but also our environment's health.	E_S0
Because of our economy and society, we have billions of car today.	B_C0
Also owing to our economy and society, there will be fewer cars in use in 20 years.	I_C0
People's awareness of heath and environment protection will make themselves choose a more corrct way to travel.	E_C0
 
I don't think it's a good idea that parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.	S_I0
Parents shouldn't spoil their children.	B_T1
It's a bad phenomenon that children ask their parents for money when they can earn money by themselves.	E_T1
FIrstly,if the children can earn money by themselves,they should do jobs to live them own.	S_M1
They hace the huge labor to make effection.	B_S0
Someone may say he can't make by himself.	I_S0
Oh,what a lazy boy.	I_S0
He isn't responsible for his life.	I_S0
Everyone has his own value for the social.	I_S0
For example,last summer,I became a tutor for teaching a child math.	I_S0
I got up early and went to work every day and I felt very satisfied.	I_S0
I realized I can be a useful person to creat value.	I_S0
Then I got the salary 3600 dallors and I can use the money to maintain my life 3 months.	I_S0
If the children can have a try,I essure they will love that feel.	I_S0
They can become independent and reliable.	E_S0
In addition,if the  parents don't offer their children money,the children will do their best to study for the scholarship.	S_M1
They can become outstanding and excellent.	B_S0
A bright future will wave to them.	I_S0
They will be busy to getting a better life.	I_S0
The lack of money will motivate their potential.	I_S0
They can understand how difficult it is to earn money.	E_S0
What's more,if parents offer the money for each high grade,the students will think it's grant to get the money.	B_C1
Until they can't get the money,they will hate their parents:why do you give me money.	E_C1
Moreover,they will waste a lot of money to do something usef	O
 
Nowadays,a number of people choose to shield about events happening around the world.	S_I0
They may have their own reasons to justify this choice.	S_T0
However, most people still determine to know about events happening around the world, even if it is unlikely that they will affect your daily lifeshielding about events happening around the world.	B_T1
From my perspective, i would express my preference that know about events happening around the world is more suitable because knowing this can expand our horizons, cultivate inereat dirction and make more friends.	E_T1
To begin with, knowing about events happening around the world provides people with the opportunity to expand our horizons.	S_M1
To be more specific, to understand the dynamic of the world can be compared with your life or job and learn other countries good place.	B_S1
On the contrary, if people choose to shield about events happening around the world, they will suffer form closed himself from the outside world.	E_S1
In addition,  knowing about events happening around the world allows people to cultivate inereat dirction.	S_M1
To some extent, can let more people know these national issues like poltics, maybe there is a chance to work after these people will go to government departments.	B_S1
For instance, my friend is a introverted person, he never cares about the political problem, once he come with me to watch the news, since then fell in love with the problems between countries, because he through it was wonderful.	E_S1
In sum,  knowing about events happening around the world enables people to gain knowing this can expand our horizons, cultivate inereat dirction and make more friends.	S_C2
Judging from the reasons listed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that	O
 
Do you remember the last time you percitipate in some volunteer activities hosted by your mommunity?	B_I0
Nowadays it's common scene that many young people are not willing to spend time helping their communities, which I don't regard as a positive phenomenon.	E_I0
From my perspective, I maintain the lack of time and desire to take part in these activities can account for this situation.	S_T0
Firstly, young people are busy and are deficient in spare time.	S_M1
Faced with increasingly intense competition, people's spare time is being compressed constantly, especially young people.	B_S0
Under these circumstances, the youth have a preference for things which can be of  benefit to their future.	I_S0
Futhermore, being fully awared of this intense competition, their parents perhaps don't want their children to waste time on things which aren't beneficial.	I_S0
For example, my uncle's son are required to take part in both piano lesson and painting lesson during the summar holiday.	I_S0
Consequently, my little niece has to get up early praticing piano in the morning and draw several paintings in the afternoon.	I_S0
This is the situation that everyone could be confronted with.	I_S0
So the youth don't have enouth time to devote to the community activities.	E_S0
Moreover, the desire of the young people to help with the community is decreasing.	S_M1
With the recreation choices increasing, young people can get a lot of fun when they play computer games or wath TV.	S_S2
When you compare the profit you obtain from take part in study program or help the community, you can figure out whiich activities attract those young people more.	S_C2
 
In this demanding society, it is getting harder and harder to get a good job.	B_I0
And whenever asked about whether it's better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents jobs than jobs that are not related to their parents' jobs, parents always exhibit an air of uncertainty.	E_I0
However, I wholeheartedly agree that it is better to choose similar jobs.	S_T0
First, children can make less mistakes if they take similar jobs to parents' jobs.	S_M0
Parents may have been in the field for many years, so there are a lot of things that they can tell their children.	B_S0
And every person will make mistakes, so parents must have made mistakes.	I_S0
In this way, they will tell their children what to do and what not to do in order to avoid the same mistakes that they have made before.	I_S0
Moreover, parents are experienced, so they can tell their children how to do their job better.	I_S0
In this way children will know more about the job and make less mistakes.	E_S0
Then, children can get relationships with important people easier.	S_M0
Parents must know a lot of people who are also working in their field, because they have spent maybe a couple of years to establish good relationships with those people.	B_S0
So if children take similar jobs, their parents can just introduce their children to those people.	I_S0
And children won't have to spend a long and tough time try to get close to those people.	I_S0
And maybe some people their parents know can help their jobs a lot.	E_S0
Last but not the least, take simimlar jobs can be good to the whole family.	S_M0
Some parents may have devoted their whole life to their own companies, so it can be better if their children can take over the companies.	B_S0
Nowadays, many parents have a successful company, which runs very well.	I_S0
There are not only material things but also spirits, efforts and memories in the company.	I_S0
In this way, it can be a pity that the company will just shut down.	I_S0
So, if the children can take the same or similar jobs to their parents', the company will not have to shut down.	I_S0
And maybe the company can be ran from generation to generation.	I_S0
Every one in the family will be happy about this.	I_S0
Isn't this a good thing to the whole family?	E_S0
To conclude, children taking similar jobs to their parents can be not only better for themselves but also better for their families.	S_C2
 
Nowadays,it has gradually become a tendency that parents always provoid awards for children when they get high grade in school.	B_T1
Though many people have their own reasons against this phenomenon,the kind of behavior still have advantages to most of children.	I_T1
In this circumstance Children are gradually aware of the rewards of his hard work is deserved and necessary,meanwhile the earlier they posses their own money,the earlier they will have a good command of it.	E_T1
It is almost acknowledged to all that when someone make effort to his work,he will get rewards in return.	S_M2
The similarity rule is absolutely adapted to children.	B_S0
To begin with,the degree of schoolwork is as heavy as adults' work.	I_S0
Many people may have a misunderstanding that chilren's task is too easy.	I_S0
Their duty is just having fun in paradise,and school is a so-called place.	I_S0
However,the fact is,if someone once experience a complete school-life,he will never complain about what kind of social work he is doing.	I_S0
Because school is a form of society,it reflects many aspects in society,the competition,the pressure and the expectation of family.	I_S0
Therefore,honestly to say,being occupied with school is challenging,children deserve rewards because of their high	E_S0
 
With the rule complete, the issue of following rule has never failed to arouse widely social concern among the general public.	S_I0
When it comes to the statement that young people follow and obey rules too strict, People usually exhibit an air of uncertainty.	B_T1
In my opinion, I think that young people to follow and obey are not too strict.	E_T1
First of all, nowadays, young people need to follow rules, otherwise societies will break.	S_S2
 
Nowadays,there are many ways to have a relax.	S_I0
compare these ways,I prefer relaxing by watching a movie or reading a book.	S_T1
We all have a lot of pressure.	B_S0
We must to set our goals and achieve them.	I_S0
After study or work we always feel tired.	I_S0
We can choose some activities.	I_S0
Reading books and watching movies also help us relax.	I_S0
Reading a book is a good habit.	I_S0
It can help us forget trouble and immersed in the story.	I_S0
A good book brings us fresh inspirations.	E_S0
Relax our mind.	S_M2
Many people like watching movies.	B_S0
By watching movies we can know many news.	I_S0
I especially like watching movie.	I_S0
I want to know movie info.	I_S0
For example, 3d movie always give us visual enjoyment.	E_S0

Due to the busy work, more and more parents have to be faced with the problem that they do not have a lot of time to spend with their children.	B_I0
Some parents choose to use the limited time to have fun playing games or sports with their children.	E_I0
Others hold the opinion that it is best to use that time doing things together that are related to schoolwork.	B_T0
As far as I'm concerned, the first one is a better choice.	E_T0
First of all, playing games with children is a great way to enhance relationship, because of the busy work, parents have a little time to spend with their children, children seldom meet their parents.	S_M1
So the distance in heart between parents and children might become very long.	B_S0
Playing game like basketball or football can effectively slove such a problem.	I_S0
These kind of team sports can make children feel that they are closely related to parents and enhance their relationship.	I_S0
Take myself as an instance.	I_S0
because of his work, I couldn't see my father for several months.	I_S0
I felt that I became unfamiliar with my father.	I_S0
But in a basketball game, I fight with my father and beat our enemy .	I_S0
I felt that my father is closely related to me, he will always stand by myside and help me face the challenge.	I_S0
Our relationship become close again.	I_S0
On the contray, doing things that related to schoolwork might make children feel that their parents only conceren their grade, and things related to schoolwork mostly don't like basketball or soceer, give participants a feeling of sticking together and fighting together.	E_S0
Secondly,  most of children don't like schoolwork.	S_M1
If they are forced to do schoolwork with parents, they may dislike or hate their parents.	B_S0
On the contray, games are something that most children like.	I_S0
if their parants invite them to play, they are likely to be happy and have a good feeling with their parents.	E_S0
Schoolwork is important, however, building a good memory with your children is far more important than it.	B_C0
Supposed you are  parents, what kind of children do you want to see, filled with memory that play happily with you, or filled with memory that sorrowly do something that he disklike with you?	I_C0
So we can easily draw a conclusion that have fun playing games with children is a better choice.	E_C0
 
I still remmenber that when I was a child, my parent always let me do the things by byself which I can do on my own.	S_I0
They encouraged me to just go can did not to afraid of the mistake I may make.	S_T1
At that time, I did not think much and do what they let, just with a feeling of free and happy.	B_S0
It was not Until now when I grow up and live life in the society did I learn that the reason why they let me make miatakes istead of teching me before is that they wanted me to learn from these mistakes by my own.	I_S0
How I am grateful for them and their behavors, for their forward-thinking and witness.	E_S0
Therefore, I would agree that parent should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.	S_M1
For one thing, parents could not be companion with their children all the time.	B_S0
They could not avoid children doing soemthing on theri own and thus, could not avoid the mistakes children made.	I_S0
Secondly, at anytime children want to do something new, if parents do not want chilldren meet any mistakes by teaching them before, children would only solve the problem as follows.	I_S0
They lose the chance to think and imagine and will not enjoy the effort of trying to overcome the difficult.	I_S0
Only when they do the things all by themselves could them learn more and grow up to be mature.	I_S0
Last but not least, it would be more impressive for children by making mistakes and learning from their own mistakes.	I_S0
In this occasion, they would not make such mistakes anymore, as they have made, tried and learned.	E_S0
Nowadays, there are still many parents afraid of their children meeting any difficulty and devoting themselves to pretecting children form any mistakes.	S_M1
In my opinion, when chileren make mistakes and would learn from these, they would normally learn better and do better in the future.	B_S0
So just let them go, encourage them to bravely do.	I_S0
What most important is to tell them to learn.	E_S0
 
With the development of the modern society, the stress of the young people is much heavier than before.	S_I0
Moreover, to deal with the complex life in the modern society, many people consider that it's important for the young people to have the planning and organizing ability.	B_T0
However, there may be some people who disagree with this statement and they think it's no need for the young people to have the ability because they are too young to have the skills.	I_T0
In my opinion, I think it's essential for the young people to have the ability to plan and organize in the modern society.	E_T0
First of all, young people should meet the requirements of the life in the modern society.	S_M1
Nowadays, the society have the much higher limit to judge the young people.	B_S0
The society is so cruel and the life is so complex that young people have to learn the ability of planning and organizing to meet the requirements of the modern society.	I_S0
For example, in the junior high school, there will be a monitor in every class.	I_S0
Sometimes the teacher have other things to deal with and the monitor student should try his/her best to organize the class and plan things in front of the teacher meeting the accidents.	I_S0
That's the circumstance the monitor can't refuse.	I_S0
So today young people should learn the ability of planning and organizing to meet the requirements of society nowadays.	E_S0
Additionally, young people having the ability to plan and organize will benefit the later life.	S_M1
Actually, if people have the ability to plan or organize the life and work when they are young, they can avoid many massy conditions and bad circumstances in their young life so they may live a better life when they grow up.	S_S2
Finally, it will be late for the people to have the ability of planning and organizing after experiencing a lot if they don't learn the skills when they are young.	B_C1
Human life is too precious to waste in the several decades of the life.	E_C1
And people may	O
 
At present, with the sake of intensive competition society,working effiectively become incresingly significant.	B_I0
Therefore, the heated debate about whether students must work together or are supposed to work alone in order to learning much more effectively has arisen.	I_I0
Some of student contend that it is not wise to work alone when teachers assign projects.	I_I0
Nevertheless,the ability of working alone to gain more effiectively is undoubtly a A-straight student needed.	E_I0
I am going to elborate my perspective in the following reasons and examples.	S_T0
First of all, Student are more motivated to study in the depth the thinking without the distraction with other parnters.	B_M0
Studying by their own personality allows them to focus on self-development and be able to rnhance the efficiency of studying	I_M0
Admittedlt, I do not mean working together have no benefits to cultviate one's well-around development.	E_M0
It exactly give us a chance to access the	O
 
I don not think providing their kids with money as a gift for their high grade is a good way to educate their kids   Firstly,it will make their kids to combine grades with money.	B_I0
It will give them a unvisable pressure to their schoolwork.	I_I0
study should be pure and with joy.	E_I0
Moeny can not be the way to push their kids to complete their schoolwork better.	S_T0
There is a example that some schools in China provide money to award the good students.	B_S1
It is proved that this way can not improve their grades but give them more pressure that some kids said if they can not get the award money the next time,it will be a shame.	E_S1
Secondly,in childrens`s mind,we should build a right and healthy concept of money.	S_M1
Apparently,combining money with their shcool grade is not a wise way for them to have their own thought of moneyKowning how to get and use money and the right character that money plays in our daily life is a important lesson of a kid.	S_S2
Thirdly,as a saying goes:study is as long as our life.	S_M1
If a kid has the thought that their grade can be used as a change of money.	B_S0
After their graduation,they will find is hard to find a new and powerful reason for them to continue study new things.	I_S0
Becausethere is not money as their award.	I_S0
In the 21 century,things change more and more rapidly.	I_S0
If we can not have the willing to improve our speed of study and even find the willing to continue study,we will be old-fashioned sooner or later.	I_S0
So it not just a unproper way to award children,but it will also effect their developement in the whole life.	E_S0
Though it has a lot of disadvantages,there is no doubt that it is a way to push the kids to complete their study better.	B_C1
But what the parents should consider is that they should find a more effective and healthy way to help not only the study of their kids,but also the developement of their kids inthe future.	E_C1
 
It is more benefit for us to travel in our country than traveling all around the word?	B_I0
Have you ever seen magnificent landscape abroad that you have never seen in your hometown?	E_I0
As a traveling amateur, I think it is more benefit from traveling to foreign countries, for the various culture and the valuable experience.	S_T0
On the one hand, the traveling in foreign countries broaden up our horizon.	S_M1
To be more convincible, we will realize different cultures if we travel to foreign countries, then broaden up our horizon.	B_S0
For instance, during our traveling in Tailand, we will join the Loy Kra Thong festival, and taking the Krathong, which is a yellow bright light in their costum to the river, to express our hopes to the god.	I_S0
Meanwhile, we not only learn the culture but also see the extremely magnificent view-- hundreds of the Krathong float in the river likes the hundreds of the stars.	I_S0
The Loy Kra Thong festival is a symbol of the culture in the Krathong which we can not realize during the trip in our hometown.	I_S0
So obviously it is more benefit for us to travel to foreign area.	E_S0
On the other hand, the traveling in foreign countries enables us to enrich our life experience.	S_M1
To be specific, we can make more friends which live in different countries to us in our trips, so we can expand our network.	S_S2
Meanwhile, we can also know some different technique t	O
 
Nowadays, the society rules to the young people are different from the ones in the past.	B_I0
Whether or not the rules are strict to the young people?	I_I0
The answer is definitely.	I_I0
It's not strict for the young people to obey the rules which the society expects.	E_I0
To begin with, the strict society rules will help the students with their study because the students will be distracted with the entertainment if they don't obey the rules.	S_M0
When I was a junior student, many classmates of mine like reading the comics and other novels, which weren't suitable for junior students to read.	B_S0
And consequently, in order to catch up with the continuous novels, a lot of students can't concentrate on the study.	I_S0
Their scores of study declined and they couldn't go to the dreaming senior school.	E_S0
Secondly, the rules will help the young people with physical and mental health, because young people who can't self-control need to be educated by the strict society rules.	S_M0
Many young people like drink beer and some alcoholic products, and also, they like smoking, too.	B_S0
The different and amazing behaviors direactly lead the students to the painful condition of the physical health.	I_S0
Without the self-control ability, many bad people around them can cause the mess of their mental health and lead them to the terrible journey.	E_S0
Thirdly, although the rules may be too strict for students to have freedom, it's more terrible that there will be a society unrest without these rules.	S_M0
If the young people don't need to obey the rules, you can imagne how messy the society will be.	B_S0
They can do many things without worrying about other's opinion.	I_S0
The society will lose control because the crazy behaviors of the young people.	I_S0
I think it's more significant that the young people should obey the rules.	E_S0
In conclusion, the rules which is defined by society is noyt strict for theyoungpeople	S_C2
 
With the development of the development of technology and society, nowadays the diversity of entertainment which we can choose are increasing.	B_T1
We can decide which way for relaxing ourselves--watching a movie ,reading a book or doing exercise.	E_T1
As far as I am concerned, I prefer doing exercise for relaxation.	S_T0
Here are my reasons.	S_T1
Firstly, exercise can help me to be more health.	S_M0
If we spend spare time exercising, then in our daily work, we can be more energetic.	B_S0
For instance,  there is a period when I have to take several exams which made me very stressed, thus I decided to take a jog in the evening.	I_S0
After some days, as I feel more enegertic and active about my work, and I felt less stressed and can do better job.	E_S0
Furthermore, I think exercise can more effectively help us to relax than wathcing movies are reading books.	S_M0
When we exercise, our body can fell tired, which can decrease the burden of our mind.	B_S0
There is a survey have done by Hongkong university that doing sports can efficiently hepl us to  think less about the things which bother us as we pay most attention to our physical movement, less concertration will be consumed on mental thoughts.	I_S0
However, when you read a book, you may find it hard to concertrate on.	I_S0
The things you worry about always spark in your mind.	I_S0
Owing to this, reading or watching may have limited positive affect on your worry.	E_S0
The last but not the least, physical exercise have more advantages for having new friends.	S_M0
There are numerous movies and books, however, the kinds of sports are far less than them.	B_S0
Thus, it can be easy for you to meet someone who are doing the same sports.	I_S0
You can imagine that youcan talk with your friends when you are jogging, playing basketball or playing volleyball.	I_S0
Also, there is a servey shows that one can be less depressed when he or she is accompanied by others.	E_S0
In a word, I think doing physicla exercise is more benificial than wathcing movie or reading books, as the sports can be more effective to decrease our stress.	S_C2
 
About the arguement that parents should give there school-age children extra money for a high score or not, I think parents should not give there children this kind of pocket money.	B_T1
I have three main reasons for holding that.	E_T1
Above all, students have to know that they study for themselves not for their parents.	S_M0
As we all known, student is a kind of charactor that regard learning as their own business, so a reward student is probably incorrect according to that.	B_S0
Students are unable to judge correct and incorrect, if their parents give them extra salary for studing they may think that they study for their parents.	I_S0
Even worse, they may connect the score to the money but not the judgement of their study.	I_S0
One of my friend, however, live in a family that parents think child need to be awarded.	I_S0
At all time she make a great answer, she is rewarded.	I_S0
After about two years, when her parents think that it is time to develop her ability of learning on her own, she really make a decrease in every exams just because she think that if the parents do not give money, study is useless.	I_S0
This is a strong evidence of the nagative influence on childs.	E_S0
Secondly, this increase the bad study habit or even cheating.	S_M0
We all knows that burn midnight oil is not correct for the school-age students because it may damage their physical and mental health.	B_S0
But driven by the money, we can easily imagine what students will do.	I_S0
According to a research maded by a educational university, over half of the high school student stay up late for studing to get a great score which means that if most of the students can get money from a high score, the situation will become worse.	I_S0
I've heard that, answer of an important exam in high school grade twelve is worth about fifty CNY, and parents' reward of that kind of exam probably as high as two hundred CNY.	I_S0
In this case, it is clear that some of students may try that kind of dishonest activity just because economic benifits.	E_S0
After all, there is one day that students become adults, if they the parents are rewarded in their childhood, the bad influence will continue.	S_M0
No one but all parents want to give their child a well enviroment, and when they are finding ways to do that, they may think that a economic reward is useful.	B_S0
So their child will suffer from the same things again.	I_S0
I have seen an article in an magazine said that there is a child who had an overlove parents, reward his students so much at every time the student have a good score.	I_S0
The students, however, have a lot of money to spend, is addicted to drags just because he have lot of money to spend and parents may care nothing but his score.	I_S0
It is an unfortunate story just cause by family.	E_S0
To be honest, these three reason provide a strong evidence for not to give school-age children money for high grade, which activity may cause serious problem then parents can imagine at the time they give.	S_C2
 
In the modern society, efficiency is a crucial point.	B_I0
The technology developing in a incrediable speed and the society growing in a amazing speed, also.	I_I0
All those will press time, making time to be more and more valuable.	I_I0
'How to improve the efficiency' is a highly-debated issue nowadays.	I_I0
Some workers may think that doing various tasks make they easier to concentrate on their works than doing similar tasks.	E_I0
since they are satisfied and relaxing.	S_T0
I totally agree with this idea.	S_T1
Frankly speaking, different tasks can help works keep fresh.	S_M2
Imagining that if a person keep doing the same thing all day.	B_S0
What is going to happen?	I_S0
The person will feels extremely tried, and disguses the thing which he repeats so many times.	I_S0
It's the reason reason, if a worker keeps working on the similar task, the worker must be tired, feeling bored.	I_S0
Moreover, the worker will never wants to stay in the company, again.	I_S0
What about working on the different tasks?	I_S0
i sure that worker will fresh all the time, then he will complete a lot of task in the short period of time, and gets a lot of salary.	I_S0
Thus , the worker must be satisfied when he is working in this way.	I_S0
Foe example, i am a student, i know the course shedule of my school.	I_S0
I never see a shedule which shows that students will have the same classes all day long.	E_S0
It is obviously, worker will prefer to work on the different tasks rather than working on the same tasks.	B_C1
By working on the various tas	E_C1
 
Have a glimpse on the society, almost all the universities invest lots of money on the classes, reaserch and the libraries.	B_I0
Maybe you will find that the facility of the sports and the social activities sometimes do not receive the equal economic support in some universities.	I_I0
Are the financial support of the exercise and social activities not important?	E_I0
Definitely not; therefore, we should invest the equal financial support on these fieds in the universities.	S_T0
In the first place, doing sports and  participating social activities are able to teach us some excellent qualities such as communiting ability and the ability of coorperating with others which we can not study from the class and libraries.	S_M0
My own experience can successfully illustrate this point.	B_S0
In the past, I was a very shy boy who had no bravety to talk with others or preach own opinions in front of the publicity.	I_S0
Finally, I participate a basketball team.	I_S0
In this social activites, I learn that we should coorperate with our mates rather than do every by myself through the harsh games.	I_S0
Aside this blessing, I find that with I always discuss the stratigies of the game, my communicating ability improve dramatically.	I_S0
Obviously, these abilities I can not study from the classes and libraries.	E_S0
In the secon place, we can get lots of physical and sychological impacts from doing sports and participating social activites.	S_M0
It is a generally-accepted fact that the students in the university have excessive pressure which not only sometimes make students upset but also hurt our body.	B_S0
Therefore, it is necessary for us to do sports and social activites.	I_S0
We cam release our pressure by talking with others about our confusion in the social activities shift our attention from the study into the appealing activies.	I_S0
For the physical health, we always sit in one place for long time, if we can play the soccor for a while, we will have a clear fealing in our brain.	I_S0
However, since some universities have poor environments of the sports and social activites for students due to the few investment on that, a broad range of students always prefer staying in the classes and libraries rather than go to the gyms.	E_S0
Finally, though some people think that it is a time waste if the students do sports and social activities, I have the totally opposing opinions.	S_M0
Simply because we can reasonally manage our time and reasonally attributing our time into the study and the sports and social activities.	B_S0
Once we charge this time managing abitlity, we will save more time and have more efficiency on our work.	I_S0
Therefore, the university must to invest the eqaul money to support this development of sports and social avtivities, which will encourage the increasing number of students attend these activiese.	E_S0
To sum up, the universities should put o	S_S2
 
In general, I agree the opnion because I think the most imporant issue is that whether it is a good choice for people to do some activities, which make them peace in mind or in body.	B_T0
To keep calm is my great desire especially when I stay in free time.	E_T0
Imagine the picture: After a busy day, you want to have a peaceful and comfortable time in sofa or to waste more energy in gym or other places?	S_T1
Obviously, In our heart, the relaxing means a peace atomosphere and feeling.	S_T0
It means we need entertainment.	S_S2
Some people argue a very strange opinion.	S_M2
Those guys say that it is better for the mordern people to do some physical exercise, because they believe in the fact that mordern people should take care of their healthy problems.	B_S0
But as we konwn, those people who have very stupit idea which consider that everyone wants to have a long lifex make others to do same thing that they want.	I_S0
Yes, It is not bad for the young to have a strong and healthy body.	I_S0
But At first, the people die when they should die, which is better for our country and for themsleves.	I_S0
Notwithstanding that some groups think the human have rights to be took care by the hosiptal, In fact it just make our country waste money for useless people.	I_S0
Second, If a guy who have a strong body through his physical exercise but he do not have enough spirit in his mind to use those physical power, he would be a kind of animals which is not a owner of hiselve.	I_S0
It is hard to say, but that is the illness in our modern people who lives in city, especially big city.	E_S0
above all, I want to call the real man in our life, which means the relaxing make the people have real power, will and encourage, which means those strong but stupid mokeies will be destroied in future.	B_C1
So relaxing by real spirit activities such as watching a movie or reading a book is important for our civilization.	E_C1
 
During the proceed of classes, it is not rare that one may have different, or even contraversial opinions against what teacher says.	B_I0
whether interrupt him or her, discuss with him or her just after classes,or even say nothing is worthwhile taking a deep thinking.	E_I0
Some people may belive it' s better to throw out the disagreement straightforward or say nothing, However, I strongly believe finding a proper chance after classes is undoutly the best choice.	S_T0
Firstly, waiting until class being finished, rather than interrupting teacher' s teaching, can create a harmony and smooth atmosphere.	S_M2
If one had disturbed the teacher with a question , the teacher may stop what is disccussed.	B_S0
Undoutedly, it may have a bad effect on the organization of class.	I_S0
As we all know that, Not only various knowledge is what we learn from teachers , but also their rigirous logic.	I_S0
Imagine that if we question teacher' s opinions straightly, the  organization of class may be disturbed.	I_S0
As a reasult, student's learning effeciency may be affected.	I_S0
Thus, talking with teacher after classes can make sure the class goes on smoothly as what the teachers plan.	I_S0
Moreover, find another choice to discuss with teacher may be a way to enhance the relationship between one and his or her teachers.	I_S0
When one face teachers alone, he can have a great amount of time to be aquainted with them, instead of talking about different arguments.	I_S0
Letting teacher know well about oneself can be extremely important in one' s academic life.	I_S0
By communicating with teacher, they may have stronger impression on one.	I_S0
Next time, if there were some suited programs needing student assistant to participate in, he or she may be the first person who come up in the teachers' mind.	I_S0
Had she  or he not talked with teachers in the ample time after class, she or he can not earn this opportunity.	E_S0
In conclusion, talking with teacher after class is not only making the class complete and go on smoothly , but also provide t	O
 
Now, people usually will attend different meetings, and sometimes , it will have some incidents in the metting and some of it is embarssing.	B_I0
But how to deal with this situation?	E_I0
I think the best way is talk to speaker after the meeting.	S_T0
First, interrupting the leader and correcting this mistake in the meeting are rude, and it will have bad influence on our development.	S_M1
For example.	B_S0
my mother told me one thing that happened in one meeting in her company.	I_S0
She said her leader was talking one thing about the analyse of  the marketing, but this leader read one word in wrong ponoucation.	I_S0
Suddenly, one staff point this mistake quickly and she use loud voice to say it.	I_S0
When she finished her speaking, the atmosphere of meeting bacame very embarssing.	I_S0
After that, the job of this staff was cancled, and the leader did not give us any reason.	E_S0
Second, if we say nothing, we will have small chance to decelop ourselves, because if we want get more benefits , we must have courage to face these problem and solve it.	S_M1
For example, in a meeting, the leader and staff are analysing the data.	B_S0
But the leader make a mistake, the date that is calcualte by her is wrong, but other staffs do not have courage to point this mistake of leader.	I_S0
So everyone say nothing in the meeting, except one staff.	I_S0
After the meeting, the staff point this mistake in a comfortable way, and his behavoir help the company avoid the loosing.	I_S0
So in order to appreciate he, the leader give her money as reward.	E_S0
Finally, after the meeting, leader has enough private space, so they would not worry the opinion of others.	B_C0
For example, one day I attend a meeting, and in this meeting, the teacher told a history.	I_C0
But when she tell the time of one historical things.	E_C0
We found the time is wrong, And after the meeting, I found the teacher, and	O
 
There is no doubt that we have many possible ways to escape from exhaustion.	B_I0
For an instance, watching TV or reading a book is a mild way to relax our tiring body, while doing exercise can comfort our exhausted brains.	I_I0
It's obviously that different relaxing ways have different functions.	I_I0
Therefore, in my point of view, I don't hold the same opnion with the statement in the Question above.	E_I0
I'll express my concrete thinking then.	S_T1
Firstly, watching TV or reading a book can rich our mind.	S_M1
So if we just have manual work and feel work out extremely, these kind of way to relax is our best choice.	B_S0
However, if we work with our brain for a long time, it's not wise enough to read a book to feel better.	I_S0
If so, you can only recieve much tirement.	E_S0
So, compared with spiritual relaxation, body relaxation can't  be chosen all the time, too.	S_M1
Only if our brains are too tired or when we just want to find joyment in excersice, can it be a good way to choose.	B_S2
There is no such thing as some relaxing way	E_S2
 
Tremendously impressed by the topic,as far as I am concened,I am totoally agree with this opinion.	B_I0
Here are my reasons.	I_I0
Nowadays,high grade means that you have a strong oppunity to achieve yourself.	I_I0
Grades have already consist of a majority of life for children.	I_I0
Higher grades refer to more colorful future.	I_I0
On no account for igorning the significant of high grade.	I_I0
In terms of recent education system,it is grade-centered.	E_I0
According to the system,every school-age child is pushing for the high grade.	S_T1
There is no doubt that this kind of stuff is able to spur the children's motivation to get high grades.	S_M1
It has a obvios good effect.	B_S0
For instance,if parents don't give pocket money to children as a gift,the children will pay no attention to study.	I_S0
Because the school-age children are too young to realize the importance of study.	I_S0
They may as well addicited into watching Tv,playing video games or somethings like these.	I_S0
Offering them money is a approach to throw a light on what they should do.	I_S0
So why not offer money for your children to let them spare no effort on their study?	E_S0
In my personal view,this is not only do a favor for the children,but also have a positive influence on the parents.	S_M1
Parents are supposed to be content with the children's high mark,and be proud of their children as well.	B_S0
In this case,offering money is able to develop the mutural understanding between parents and their children.	I_S0
Through this slight behavior,the whole famliy will lead a more delight life.	I_S0
With this way,parents will no more argue with children for the poor grade.	E_S0
Above all,offering school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is definitely a good idea.	B_C1
I hold a agreement with these parents.	E_C1
 
As we know some of prarents give their childs different sum of money for their mark in their school.	S_I0
they think that this is a king of "encouragerment" of the kids and can make them feel happier when they are learning.	B_T0
in my opion,the idea is good but they do it in a wrong way.	E_T0
kids as i know,first most of them would more likely choose to play on the playground compare with study by the desk.	S_M1
so is quite importent to let them know about the importance of learning and the happiness in learning.	B_S1
that's correct,but use money to encourage them to study is not a good way.	E_S1
there are several problems.	S_M1
First,this kind of payment would let them feel like learning is a kind of work,and they should be pald for what they done.	B_S0
however learning is a method to ipmrove oneself not a work.	I_S0
some of  the kids even find uncorrect way to raise thier“payments ”like cheating in exams to get a better score to get more money,this kinds of behaviors is totally different of "encourage to study".second in my rembership when i was young, I dont know the importance of money,and even in shcool I just put my wallet on my desk,so young children dont know how to protect their money well,also they don't know how to use the money.	I_S0
they night use it to buy some dangerous items like fireworks to play,and it will surely become a dangerous elements of thier safety.	E_S0
So students need a way to encourage they to study ,but give money is not a good choise ,what shall we do？	B_C0
As for me,I would choose to submit to go out  to play toghter in some good place like theme park or cinema.	I_C0
compare with just buy something to child ,this way not only encourage student to study hard to get reward,but also give a chance for parents to stay toghter with their kids,more thier comunicate they know more about each other,last but not least,is there are parent beside, they can control thier kids not to do some dangerous behavior when playing,it's much more safe than let kids to play alone.

In many factories, workers always have many task to do, sometimes they do the similar task to do all day long.	S_T1
But i think whey they have different types of tasks to do during the workday, they will be satisfied.	S_T0
It won't make the workers feel uncomfortable.	S_T1
Firstly, their will work more effectively whey then do fiverse task during the workday.	S_M0
they can try many new task whey they feel boring.	B_S0
They don't need to focus on one task for whole day.	I_S0
So they can make the work better.	I_S0
For instance, during our school time, the student have different subfect in one day, they don't need to spend one day in same classroom.	I_S0
After 45 minutes, they will change to a new environment.	I_S0
And there will also be an new teacher, it won't make the student feel confused.	I_S0
It's always easier for student to adapt the knowledge.	I_S0
And it  as same as the work to have all kinds of task.	I_S0
when they finish all tasks in one day, they will be proud of themselves.	E_S0
Secondly, it's also benefit for the factories.	S_M0
The worker can finish many types of task, so the factory won't limited to make one kind of good in one area, they can make out more different kinds.	B_S0
So when the costmer come to buy something, they can fin all they need, it will be very convenient for them.	I_S0
So it can attract more custmers, then the factories will got more benifts, the workers will also got more.	E_S0
Thirdly, there is not denying that do the similar task will save more time, people can pay attention on one thing, thay don't need to waste time to  change to other task.	S_M0
But the problem is that nobody like to do one thing in one day,their emotion will benegative.	B_S0
They can not concentrate on it anytime, so it will affect the quality of the task.	I_S0
These result is not good enough.	I_S0
So it's better for them try many other things during the work day.	E_S0
In conclusion, wokers will be satisfied whey they have many different types of task  during workday.	B_C0
None will be excited if they spend whole day to do same thing.	I_C0
Just like our life, people enjoy trying different thing during their life time.	E_C0
 
I can say that I'm totally agree with the fact that paRENTS SHOULD LET kids make mistakes and to learn from their mistakes by theirself.	S_T0
First,theories that learnde by ourselves always roots deeper in our minds.	S_M0
In this internaet generation ,people can get the tuition they need on the internet quite easily.	B_S0
But,most of the words would just pass by as they've never exist.	I_S0
Only the lessons that were learned by our own mistakes can stay longer in our brain.	E_S0
Second,parents got to let their big babies do the thing they need to do sooner or later.	S_M0
Because it's not that possible for parents to stick together with their kids forever,there would be a day that you can'thelp your baby any more.	B_S0
Thus,babies have to learn to study from their falses by theirselves from now on.	I_S0
Other else,they will loose their mind after you leave them.	E_S0
Third,parents should be more confident about your kid.	S_M0
Believe in your kid,they might not be good enough now,but they are growing up.	B_S1
Just like egle moms would push their babies out from their nusts to let them learn flying,human moms should also let it go,let her\im explore the colorful world,let them learn how to cope with responsibilities caused by their mistakes.	E_S1
Last but not the least,parents should really stop nagging.	B_C0
For children,making mistakes is forgivable,you don't really have to blaim them for their unoccasinal mistakes.	I_C0
Also, it is true that children are always clever enough to learn from their mistakes.	I_C0
So just nag less,let yhe	E_C0
 
Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether teachers should be paid at least as much as doctors, lawyers or business leaders are paid.	B_I0
Some people claim that the teachers should not be paid at least as much as doctor, lawyers or business leaders are paid.	I_I0
However I would stand on their opposite side and I believe teachers should be paid at least as much as doctors.	E_I0
And my reasons can be seen as follows:	S_S2
First of all, teachers is as important as other jobs, even teacher is more important than other jobs, so they should be paid for more.	S_M1
As we all know, children is the world's further.	B_S0
And the teacher is the leader for children to lead them grown.	I_S0
If children leave with teacher, children would not get enough knowledge and experience to grown.	I_S0
So teachers is more important than other jobs, they should be paid more.	I_S0
For example, let's image a world without teacher, none teach the children any experience to live and any kowledge to work.	I_S0
I believe that the world must will extinct, because they do not have new force to maintain the transform of the world.	E_S0
What's more, teachers is a respacted job, so they should ger more rewards.	S_M1
All of us have many teachers, and they accompany our grown.	B_S0
I believe everyone must have an pressured teacher.	I_S0
They must give us a big influence in our life.	I_S0
So they should be respected and get more rewards.	I_S0
For example, I still remember my first physics teacher, she is so beautiful, and she usually encourage me, because I usually answer the question in the class.	I_S0
Finally I love physics, and I always have a good grades on physics.	I_S0
So I thank for my physics teacher.	E_S0
In a nutshell,  teachers is as important as other jobs, and  teachers is a respacted job.	S_S2
So I think teacher should be paid more rewards than other jobs, such as doctors, lawyers and business leaders.	S_C2
 
Although some of people think that teacher is the best people who educate students will influence students most，i totally disagree with this statement.	B_T0
In my opinion，I think that the friends will influence us more than a teacher.	E_T0
The reasons are we trust our friends，friends have lots same characteristics with us，there are some competition between friends.	S_T1
First of all，In my opinion，friends will influence you because you trust them.	S_M0
For example，when we have argument with our parents，we usaually talk to out friend and share the minds.	B_S0
Nobody would like to the teacher.	I_S0
We will think that friends' thought is more familiar with us.	I_S0
And find the agreement in friendship.	I_S0
Due to this situation I think，we will be influence by our friends because we trust them more than teacher.	E_S0
On the other hand，I thinks friends have lots same characteristics with us.	S_M0
We usually shopping with friend.	B_S0
And often have the same clothing style with them.	I_S0
If they do something we will follow them and do the same thing.	I_S0
Such as your friend like to play basketball by accident.	I_S0
She or he must will let you play with basketball too.	I_S0
When the time gone.	I_S0
You will like to play basketball too, So I think students will be influence by friends.	E_S0
Lsatly， Friends will influence us more also can be a bad thing.	S_M0
For example，Your friends have the bad habit with smoking.	B_S0
If you feel this is a kind of cool thing.	I_S0
And try to do it to show you are special.	I_S0
And also，If them buy a bag which is very expensive because of the brand.	I_S0
Most of the studens don't want be the poor guy in their friends views.	I_S0
So that they will ask parents for money and buy a bag which is more expensive than friends' to show off.	E_S0
In conclusion， I think friends will influence students more than teacher，because it is not only influence with the study，but also some social way.	B_C1
And the reasons are we trust our friends than teacher，friends have lots same characteristics with us，there are some competition between firends.	E_C1
 
Nowadays, parensts pay increasing attention to their children's education.	S_I0
in order to encourage their children's study motivation, it is not uncommon that many parents give money to their kids when they get high grads in school.	S_T1
In my view, I do not think it is an effective and resonable way ,which may lead to adverse effect.	S_T0
Since school-age children is not old enough to shape an entire value, giving money directly as reward may lead them to wrong value.	S_M1
it is important to leat children aware that the reason to get high score is to become wiser and more competent in order to gain an edge in this society.	B_S0
If children be rewarded with money every time they get high score, they may develop into thinking that their purpose to study hard is to get money only.	I_S0
Without holding in mind to improve themselves, they may cheat in exam in order to get high scores instead of studying really hard.	I_S0
Therefore, giving money as rewad for children's high score may enable the children to form a wrong value of studying.	E_S0
As far as i am concerned, there are many other ways can be used to reward schoool-age children when they recieve high scores in school.	S_M1
For example, parents can buy their children some interesting science or atrs books each time they get high mark.	B_S0
It is known to all that children are always eager to meet new and interesting things in their life, so they will be wiling to read some books that they have not been touched before.	I_S0
In the same time, they can learn more from books and their minds will be opened, horisen broadened.	I_S0
This is beficial for them a they may be more interested in study and learn on their own .	E_S0
All in all, giving money directly to children is not a good way to encourage them which can lead them to wrong road.	B_C1
It is benificial to offer them books which can in turn inspire their minds.	E_C1
 
i think it has many ways to look	S_S2
if the children make mistake more time but the parents take out the point but the children don not care about the mistake.	B_T1
the parents should taik with children about what the problems the children take.	E_T1
And WHAT shuld do to be better.	S_T0
but i think this problems should be point out better with children.	S_M0
because the parents find the problem is only the parents look out .	B_S0
children don not see himself.	I_S0
his problem be find is only by his parents.	I_S0
not by himself.	I_S0
so the mistake he done is easier in more time.	I_S0
his thinking not happen the mistake and maybe he think his done is right	E_S0
And if he find something is terrible and then he find he do something is wrong.	S_M0
then he will be clearly to remember why the thing he do himself is not good.	B_S0
he will do the same thing at head.	I_S0
and in more time to find the problem.	I_S0
Although he will take more time to correct.	I_S0
because the long time he fing the mistake he will take deep memory to remember the mistake.	I_S0
it almostly take lesson.	I_S0
if teacher has lesson only with you.	I_S0
you will spend more thinkingabout the lesson.	I_S0
because their no other people with you.	I_S0
theteacher asking question is only with you.	I_S0
you can not take more thinking in other things.	I_S0
if you find the problem yourself.	I_S0
the problem is only taken out with yourself.	I_S0
ont other people find with you.	I_S0
So your memory is more deep.	E_S0
But IF TAKE MISTAKE only with children .	S_M0
it will be take mistake.	B_S0
if you take exam tomorrow.	I_S0
your will be in infinity time to spread out many many question.	I_S0
AS you know.	I_S0
it will be not all the the question you will spreaD.	I_S0
so in this time you should talk with your classmates.	I_S0
because the exam is tomorrow.	I_S0
So your memory will not should be very deep.	I_S0
and your will take more time in many things you don not know.	E_S0
So I think in different situation you can take differents ways to do	S_S2
 
Nowadays, many teachers and parents want students do many exercise like physical in their free time,  because they  think it is a good way for relax students and they even think it is better than watching a movie or reading a book.	S_I0
I'm really can't understand it and i think it is incorrect.	S_T0
Afterwards, I think the reason of teachers and parents want use the different kind of exercise to full of students free time just want them have a good grads but have a happy life.	S_T1
On the one hand,  I think the meaning of movie and book's existence is that make people feel relaxed after the heavy schoolwork and busy work.	S_M1
In a recent report, people think the most meaning of movies is that relax people, and te books also is make people relaxed in the free time.	B_S0
I think so.	I_S0
Although the first reason of creat the movies and books just in order to stay and transmission knowledge, but after the progress and changes of these so many years, movies and books already become the way for people relax.	I_S0
Many people choose watching a movies or reading books, but do many exercise of physical.	I_S0
So I think the better way for students to relax is watching a movie and reading books.	E_S0
On the other hand, the way that do exercise of physical must not the way of make people relax.	S_M1
A report newspaper said do exercise is one of the good way for exercise one's IT number.	S_S2
Because of that, do exercise must not ther good way for people to do relax	O

With remarkable development of technology, more and more ways of entertainment arise, among which the most popular ones have to include television and movies, especially for young people.	S_I0
Therefore, there is an interesting debate about whether these two ways of entertainment have more negative effects than positive ones on young people.	B_T0
From my perspective, I would say they have more positive effects.	E_T0
First and foremost, movies and television enrich young people's social lives.	S_M0
It is often the first choice for teenage and youth to hang out and go to see a movie with their best friends at leisure.	B_S0
This is not only a way of relaxing and refreshing, but also a great chance to share their mind with their peers.	I_S0
All of this experiences is essential for one's growth and leave them lots of memories simultaneously.	I_S0
For example, I prefer to see a movie with my roomates after exams.	I_S0
Every time we would talk about a variety of things on the topic of the movie, sometimes even beyond it.	I_S0
It is during this period that we get to know each other better.	I_S0
And our relationship grows.	I_S0
This is part of my social lives.	E_S0
Besides, they can also enrich young people's imagination.	S_M0
Teenagers are full of imagination and fatacies, which can exactly met by movies and TV series.	B_S0
Those creative plots as well as incedible scenes are so impressive that they would easily get access to the cultivation of imagination.	I_S0
And as is widely acknowledged, imagination is what partly made of our developed society and prosperous civilization today.	I_S0
When I was a little boy, those super heroes and fantastic power in marvel's movies appeal to me.	I_S0
And I was eager to figure out how can they do that.	I_S0
I guess that is why I become a physics student today-- to explore the unknown power with imagination.	I_S0
It is these movies that provide me with such motivation and ability.	E_S0
Admittedly, movies and TV would spread some inappropriate words or ideas.	S_M0
But as a sort of media, that is unavoidable.	B_S1
And I believe that young people would have the ability to tell from positive things and negative things, from integrity to crime if they receive right education.	E_S1
To put it in a nutshell, movies and television do have more positive effects on teenage and youth.	B_C1
I believe that what people need to is to encourage them grow	E_C1
 
Nowadays, due to the development of society, the issue of how poeple can stay healthy has increasingly become a controversial topic.	S_T1
Some believe that the old should do more exercise, while others believe that the young should do it more.	B_T0
Although I have some doubts, I tend to agree with the latter, and I will aticulate my view below.	E_T0
First, it is the young who don't like sports more.	S_M1
Currently, with the spreading of mobilephones, increasing youngsters are willing to play it all day rather than go out with their friends.	B_S0
And it is more convenient for them to make freinds on the internet.	I_S0
Besides, all of daliy goods can be bought online, so there is no use to go out for walking.	I_S0
On the contrary, the old are more willing to hang out owing to the difficulty of technology for them.	I_S0
The only one entertainment for them is go out with their family or friends.	E_S0
In addition, the young people always stay up too late, which is harmful to their health.	S_M1
Now it is very common to see that the young individuals will go to bed at midnight due to the mass of work or excessive entertainment.	B_S0
And next day they also have to get up early to go to school or work, which contributes to their badly lack of sleep.	I_S0
Therefore, massive the young are unhealthy because of the above.	I_S0
On the other hand, the old always keep a healthy schedule everyday.	I_S0
They will get up early to walk or dance in the park.	I_S0
And after mealtime, they will hang out as well and fall asleep early, which lots of young persons cannot do it.	E_S0
As a whole, although the pld people seems so weak that they need to do some sports to stay healthy, actually recent young people require more exercise than the old.	S_C2
 
it is a good idea to offer their children money for their high grade.	S_I0
we need to do something if we want to get something.	B_T1
when we grow up we need to make our own life.	I_T1
As a tudent need to use our own way to money.	E_T1
so i think it is a good way to encourage children to study.	S_S2
From ancient times to modern time,a good incentive systemis need to establish complete	O
 
Have you ever watch some attracitve advertisements on TV?	B_I0
Nowadays, more and more advertising shows that their products have different kinds of functions which even countless.	I_I0
However, advertising is truly a effective way to attrack potential consumers, so there is no doubt that most of the business men like to beautify their product.	E_I0
To begin with, for some food corporations, an attractive advertising can make consumers more willing to tastes the product, and stimulates comsumer's appitite.	S_M1
In fact, an exaggerasive advertising can make the product seems more delicious.	B_S0
For instance, some cookie advertising will shows that their cookie are full of milk inside, if you bite the cookie, the milk will spurt.	I_S0
However, the milk can never spurt out from cookie, but the phenomenon makes the customers have curiosity about the cookie.	I_S0
Then they will buy the cookie for trying.	I_S0
In brief, it's a effective way to improve the profit for food corporation to put such a appealing advertising.	E_S0
On the top of that, most of the car corporations are making the products seem much appealing since corporations want to show their customers that the car have such a good prefomance.	S_M1
For instancem the family car advertising shows that the	O
 
I agree with today young people are better able to make decisions about their own lives.	S_T1
first of all ,today different peoplr has more diffferent ideas ,they also undstanding what thing is dad or good , they has blong their ides or world value, they can choise what their want to do, everting their like,for example	S_S2
 
This is a fast developing era that people are busy to do many things but instead they can't always do it well in the same moment.	S_T1
Many things mean that they are many potential unstable on your way.	B_T0
Take myself  for interpretation, I do agree that people are busy doing so many different things, they do very few things well.	E_T0
Fist and the foremost, the point is that planning can never include all the accidents.	S_M0
I always can't concentrate many things in the same period and always screw up the things.	B_S0
Take the recently for example, I have entered in the government to get more experience for my own career, but I failed my tests and felt really a loser.	I_S0
I have lost my passion to encourage myself to chase my dream, I have made every part of my life in a mess, but I still have to stick on it, becanse no one can really help me to do these things.	I_S0
So it's really less things that I can do well.	E_S0
What‘s more is, focusing one thing at a time can results a better result.	S_M0
Because we can always know that if you drunk yourself in the study you can get good grades, expecially the college final exams.	B_S0
I am not a regular student that take the class routine, but I can get good grades in the exams, on the opposite, one of my roommates always feel strange why I can overpass her.	I_S0
The only reason is that I always copy the notes of the class before the test day for about one week.	I_S0
I only let myself in the library for a couple of days without any communication with others.	I_S0
I do many improtant works before the test to find out the point that teacher want to test.	I_S0
Needless to say, I always forget after the test but it's really useful for the test.	E_S0
Last but not the least, to find your own way is a top way to solve many accidents, reaserchers once said the mpst people do poor jobs under the multiple conditions, they can never know how big potential they have, only when you are under the stress will your ability can be inspired to do many things.	S_M0
In the nutshell, I stand the opposite side to say that people can do many things and do them well.	B_C1
These is a positive way for many people and for myself is a mode that I want to achieve in the future.	E_C1
 
According to the development of the ecnomy and civiliazation,people are richer,kinder and more sympathetic than before.	B_I0
We know more knowledge and know more than before.	I_I0
We have broader horizon ,the higher quality of education.	I_I0
Maybe we could only meet few people in some years before,because the development of each countrie's relationship are not enough.	I_I0
But now, this world is a international world.	I_I0
We will meet so many different strangers who they come from any single place in the world.	E_I0
And we are more willing to talk with them and be friend with them.	S_T0
I think it is very interesting and fresh.	S_S2
Firstly,our school pay so much attention of teaching us should be willing to help strangers.	S_M1
We always could read some sentences of a boy lead a route for a foreinger ,and give a seat to a pregnant woman or a old man.	B_S0
Our socity encourage us to do these.	I_S0
We read these books when we are very young.	I_S0
We have known these senses many years ago.	I_S0
But many years ago,the goverment didn't pay so much attention to this place.	I_S0
So we are willing to help the struggling strangers.	E_S0
Secondly,we are richer than before.	S_M1
In many years ago.	B_S0
Our country is veru poor,even we could have a good meal by ourselves.	I_S0
So we have no ability to help some strangers.	I_S0
If you could not live well by yourself.	I_S0
How can you help some strangers?	I_S0
But now,our country is better than before.	I_S0
Most people they can live a good life.	I_S0
So we have ability to help some  struggling strangers.	I_S0
Because we could have steady income and have a better life by ourselves.	E_S0
Finally,in my mind.	B_C0
I think most people of this world are kind.	I_C0
They are willing to help some struggling strangers.	I_C0
But most time we have no money or time to help them,or these strangers they want to trick you or cheat you.	I_C0
They are kind,but they don't want to be hurt.	I_C0
So ,most people are kind and sympathetic,they willing to help some strangers.	E_C0
 
Do you like to take any history courses during colleage time, even your major subject is art or any irrelevent majors with history?	S_I0
Of course, the answer is not.	B_T1
Now, some say learnning from history will make students more perspective and clever in their future life or carreer.	E_T1
For this statement, I just support a few parts for it, then I will illustrate my opinion below this paragraph.	S_T0
As we all know, stuednts had already took hisyory courses during their primary school, middle schol and high school.	S_M1
I really think the studying time for students to study history is fillful.	B_S0
To take myself as an example, I used to learn about my country's past events during the primary school, which means I took 6 years to study history.	I_S0
After that, I went to my middle school to learn USA's history for 3 years.	I_S0
Then, high school porvided some courses for me to aquire konwlege about the world's history.	I_S0
Above all, I it is actually unnecssary for me to take such course during the university!	E_S0
In addition, history is turely helpless for some major, like math, design and astronomy.	S_M1
For instance, can you tell me what can I get some values in some old stories as a scientists?	B_S0
Compare to put some concentration on that, I prefer to focus on my research or term papers in order to get better jods instead.	I_S0
Because I can not get any credicts from that .	E_S0
Finally, some say that history will make you smart and establish a reat relationship during you carrer periods.	B_C1
For this, Icould also say that all subjects can give benefits to people, such as math make human deal with things logically or language mahe students outgoing.	E_C1
Should we learn	O
 
If you are a mother, will you allow your children to watch TV, which will have some advertisement toward them?	B_I0
And do you think those advertisement is harmful or healthy?	I_I0
From my perspective, children are too young to heed what's the real content of the advertisement and what they will get are always somthing meaningful and funny.	E_I0
Thus, I really dissagree with the statement and they should be permitted rather than prohibited.	S_T0
Because of the high imitation ability of young children, new words spoken by the people in the advertisement can really help chidren extend their knowledge.	S_M1
The best instance to illustrate this is my mother, who give birth to my sister 4 years ago.	B_S0
Surprinsingly, my sister can always speak some words which are extremely difficult for a girl aged only 4 and she actually can not understand the actually meaning what of she speaks.	I_S0
Once fortunately, when I watch TV with her and find that the words she learns about are all from the TV advertisement, which means she dose not care about the real information in the advertisement because it is so difficult for her to undersand and she can simulate the pronounciation from the speaker to enlarge her vocabulary.	I_S0
That is to say, televison advertising directed toward children seems like that children will be affected by the untrue information in the advertisement and may even be attracted by the toys to ask buy one, but actually they are too young to notice those commercial information and can gain helpful thing, including new words, new gesture, mew movement, and so on.	E_S0
Television advertising will always contain some energetic dancing movement, melodic music, colorful scenery and etc and thus those things can really inspir young children to make them have positive mood, which is the most essential thing for young children.	S_M1
Take myself as a example to explain my perspetive.	B_S0

Nowadays,more and more families are getting wealthy,and there is more and more parents offer money for their children when they get high grade in school,maybe they want to encourage their children to study hard,and show how they care about their children,but in my opinion,I don't think its a good way.	S_T1
First,children may complain and don't want to work hard anymore if their parents don't offer their money when they get high grades.	S_M1
Lily is one of my classmates,she uesd to get money reawrds when she got a high grade,but one day her parents think maybe she shouldn't be reawrded any time she get a high grade,they only reawrd her once in a year,but Lily didn't agree with them,so she began complaining and she don't work hard to resist her parents,at last,her parents had to offer her money,and her grade had gone down for a long time.	B_S1
So we can see that when student get used to their reawrds,they may complain about that.	E_S1
Moreover,it's a way to tell their children that they are working for money instead of working for knowledge.	S_M1
At first,child will work hard to get more money,but they will lose the purpose that why they study.	B_S0
Jack's parents offer him money when he get a good grade,he used to work hard to get it ,but one day he find that he can also get it even he don't work hard,he can  do it well by staying up to study before the exam,it's a good way to get good grade and gain money,but he can't acknowlegde anything,even if he can answer the question,it's a short time memory,he will forget it soon once he pass his exam.	I_S0
Money rewarding may make child forget what they study for.	E_S0
In my opinion,offering money can stimulate the children's interest in study,but it can't last a long time,once their parents don't give them money,they may receed o lot,besides,it can guide a wrong way to the children that they may became greedy in money but not in knowledge.	B_C1
So I don't think it is a good idea.	E_C1
 
People always are willing to hold a celebrities when there are millstone in their life.	S_T0
Some people claim that this opinion of celebrities are supposed to put more value for younger people than the older people.	B_T1
Nevertheless, I am in tune with the point that this kind of opinions are more important for the older people.	E_T1
In the first place, the celebrities are able to encourage more older people to challenge themselves even they are in an old age.	S_M1
It is a generally accepted fact that almost common sports activeties such as basketball, soccor, and the tennis are more mastery for the younger people.	B_S0
Gradually, owing to the fact that increasing number of celebrities for the younger people, the status of older people in these activities are undermined.	I_S0
This phenomenon lead older people feel dismay for themselves and gradually quit these stages.	I_S0
Therefore, the celebrities are more important in this situation for the older people because these celebrities can enable older man confidente for themselve.	I_S0
Thus, older man can equip the ability to improve their ability and challenge themselves.	E_S0
In the second place, these oppinions of celebrities are more valuable for younger people because the absence of life experience of younger people when they compare with the older people.	S_M1
It is well known for us that young people still have a long way to learn how to pass their whole life; nevertheless, the older people alread have their own experience to achieve their success and their know the best suitful way for them.	S_S2
In the most common situation, the opunions of celebrities are their direct and effective way to be success	O
 
I don't think it is a very goog idea.	S_T0
The children always follow the things that their parents attached importance to.	S_T1
And to give thier children money is a way to tell the childred that they like these things very much.	S_T0
Although to get a good grades is a good way to show that the children is doing good in subjects,it cannot be thought so important.	S_T1
First of all,it difficult to find a standrad on it.	S_M1
Differet subjects aren't the same,some are easy while others may be difficlut.	B_S0
And the children may be good at some while being bad at others.	I_S0
It's not so important.	I_S0
Everyone has what they love and what they are good at.	I_S0
It isn't necessary to do well in every subject.	I_S0
If you spend a lot of time doing what you hate,it is truly a waste of time.	E_S0
Secondly,childred are all anxious about the money of their own but sometimes it is so difficult to get the result.	S_M1
thus,they may think of some other way in order to get the point.	B_S0
They may cheat in class,or do something else bad.	I_S0
It's not good for them.	E_S0
The parents are the people who influence the children a lot.	B_C0
In my opinion,it's necessary to think twice before you decide what to do with your children.	I_C0
It'll change their thoughts about the world.	E_C0
 
Such is parents nature that they hope their children are good at study and get high grades in every test.	B_I0
In order to encourage children to do well in the exams, some parents will give them money as a reward for high grades.	E_I0
Though this behavior may be effective to some extent, I hold the belief that doing good in study and exams is students' duty, and the money as rewarded is not essensial and may sometimes harmful.	S_T0
To begin with, if one is emerged in study and possesses a good attitude, then his grades wil be high naturally without the money offered.	S_M0
A great number top students that I make acquaintance with, they are all hard working and got high marks in almost every subject during the final.	B_S0
However, few of them gor money from their parents as a prize.	I_S0
Thus, it can be inferred that one gets high mark because he place study at an important position, and it is himslef that make him get high marks not the rewarded money.	E_S0
Secondly, providing children with money for good grades can sometimes be a potential factor leading to unsteady family relationship.	S_M0
Take my cousin as an example, he was rewarded 20 yuan if he got one subject with grade 100 in the grade 3 finals.	B_S1
Then, when he got another 100 in the grade 4 final, he argued that he should be rewarded 30 yuan, for the subjest is much more difficult than that of grade 3, but his parents disagreeded and there was a fierce conflict in the end.	E_S1
Last but not least, giving children money for hig marks can make them misunderstand the reason of studying.	S_M0
Such behavior may lead them to the pointview that if I study hard, then I will get money doing nothing.	B_S0
Wheras such things do not happen in the society.	I_S0
So when they got another high mark but no money was given, they will question their parents.	I_S0
And if they realize that no money for high grades, they may pay little attention to study.	E_S0
In conclusion, offering children money for high grades is a behavior with good begining, that parents wish their children to study hard in order to do well in the exams.	B_C0
But rewarding money isnot a good solution, there are several ways to achieve the goal, such as developing the children's interest in study, raise their curiosity and so on.	I_C0
From my perspective, parents should choose a more correct way to emc	E_C0
 
The children are our future and our country's future, and how to give our kids a bright future is the task of both families and societies.	S_I0
It's always been a controversial topic about how to teach the youngest properly.	B_T1
Because we all have different parenting styles.	E_T1
however, I think parents definitely should let the children make and learn from their own mistakes.	S_T0
and I will illustrate that by stating the following reason.	S_S2
First of all, kids will not born with the concept what is right what is wrong, and the environment that they spend their time through childhood is the factor that defines who they are, like their habits, their personalities, and their skills.	S_M0
So kids learn from their surroundings.	B_S0
For example, I saw a documentary about a boy that lives in Ukraine.	I_S0
That kid is neglected by the irresponsible parents.	I_S0
Before he was funded by the police, he lives with the dogs, that is a terrifying story.	I_S0
But what interesting is that the kids 4years old kid actually start behaving like a dog, and he survived because the dog provides the shelter for the kid.	I_S0
As a consequence, he behaves more like a dog.	I_S0
Lucky, the kid was funded by the polices, how adopted by foster parents.	I_S0
And as this story shows the kid learn from their surroundings.	E_S0
And second, youngster make mistakes, and as human, we all make mistakes no matter who we are.	S_M0
It's ridiculous not to allow the kids to make mistakes.	B_S0
To illustrate that, a very famous congressman, he donates money to a lot of hospitals, and start a program that eventually helped a lot of homeless people.	I_S0
No one would know he was behind bars when he was younger.	I_S0
Like most of the other problem teenagers, he drinks alcohol, and abuse drugs, and even distribute it.	I_S0
but those are not important, the most important is that he learned his lesson, and he turns out to find.	I_S0
most of the people, even so-called success people makes mistake, there is no point don't let kids make mistakes.	E_S0
But sometimes, make mistake is not a good thing, it may destroy your future if the congressman didn't learn from his mistake, how to know what he will be today.	S_M0
there is a reason teacher, parents and even the justice system exists, they give hope to other people, to guide they learn from their mistakes, and that is the most important thing.	S_S2
To wrap up, parent absolutely should allow kids to make and learn from their mistakes, we all are human, we make mistakes, and the most important thing is we learn from them.	B_C1
That process makes us a better person.	E_C1
 
With the expansions of college enrollement , there has been an increasing number of undergrates waiting to be hired.	S_T1
But  what comes next for them is to figure out what type of work they want to locate.	S_T0
Opinions are divergent on this point.	S_T1
For my part, I sincerely concede that it is better for students to choose a job which is quite similar to theri parents' jobs.	S_T0
To start with, the expeience that you can amass from observing you parents work indirectly and directly can give you additional asstes which benefits you greatly when you compete with other candidates.	S_M1
Supposing that , if you want to be a teacher and you apply to a republic school.	B_S0
Wehn you are interviewed by the principals, you can leave them good impresion with your systermatic teaching methods and comprehensive understanding of students problems both physically and mentally.	I_S0
Actually,it is the familarity with your parents' job that makes you distinctive among the other contestants.	E_S0
And it is knowed that sometimes your family bond can help you a lot in the job selection.	S_M1
You parents may know some of the powerful figures of their business lines, who can have a decisive function in you job appling.	B_S0
To put it more specifically , if you and the other candidate are quite well quailfied for the same job-accounting job.	I_S0
And the employer cannot choose one of you two instantly.	I_S0
And then you happen to know you parents should know the employer.	I_S0
So you can take advantage of your parents bonds or business lines to benefit you a lot .	E_S0
But do remenber that you hardwork and your talent is the paramount element that can assure you the bright future.	B_C0
Also the interest can be a proactive tool for you to better exploit you potential.	I_C0
All in all, just take the chance to fully utilize the bonds you have and spare no effort to exploit you potential , and you can assure a permanent and satisfactory job.	E_C0
 
With the development of the entertainmrnt industry.	B_I0
Today, almost every young people has their own favorite actors and athletes.	I_I0
And it's seems that these idols have a great influence to young people than to the elderly.	E_I0
However, I think it is the same important  that the entertainers and athelets to the elderly.	S_T0
First of all, the works of these actors and so on can enrich the life of the elderly.	S_M1
As we all know, without jobs, old people always have a retively boring life.	B_S0
Because of their unhealthy body, they also can't go out to contact any intersetings and funs.	I_S0
I think  it's very important to the elderly to watching some movies or some sports competitions through TV.	I_S0
So these entertainers and atheletes are also important to the elderly.	E_S0
Futhermore, these celebriyies' works can also broaden the elderly's horizon.	S_M1
Generally speaking, because always stay at home, the elderly are hard to know about that the news outside.	B_S0
Only by reading nespaer or some other books, and watching TV, can they know that what happened all over the world.	I_S0
So i think this celebrities are very important to the erderly.	E_S0
Although many people think that the infuence of the celebrities are more imporatant than to older people, but I insist that its also indepensable to the older	S_C2
 
The society is developing with high speed, so our family will have some changes because of this development, but I think the extended family is more important than before, because our family can understand us, they will support us forever without any conditions and they can give us usaful suggestions.	S_T0
First, our family can give us understanding.	S_M1
Our society speed of development become fasre and faster, and everyday we have got to deal with every thing.	B_S0
When we cope with something, maybe we will make some mistakes, and in that case, nobody can understand you, they just want to see a good results and they do not care about you.	I_S0
So in that case, just our family can encourage us and give us courage to face these trouble.	I_S0
Becasue the understanding of family, we can continue our life with a good condition.	E_S0
Second, our family can give us usaful suggeation.	S_M1
Because in a extended family, there are many people that have abandance experience, and they will give us suggestions directaly.	B_S0
For example, one day , I have some trouble with my best friends, and I do not know how to deal with this situation, I ask my classmates for help, but their strategy that do not have any usage, and some of us is afraid of having some trouble, so they  ignore me.	I_S0
And I told this thing with my grandma, and my grandma suggeats me to calm down, and analyse the conflicting.	I_S0
If it is my fault, I should apologise to my friend, but if it is my friend's fault, I should give her a chance.	I_S0
So I use this suggestion, and we forgive eah other.	E_S0
Finally, our family can help us achieve our dream, because they will suppor us forever.	B_C0
For example, when I was a child, I am interested in playing piano, but my classmates laugh at my idea, because they thought that I did not fit to do it.	I_C0
And I told this thing to my family, and all of them support me, and encourage me to finish this thing bravely.	I_C0
And they found a teacher to teach me.	I_C0
When I feel tired or I wanted to give up, they always mentioned me that I should overcome this trouble and achieve my dream.	E_C0
Because my family always suppor	O
 
Recently, the number of wild animals are decreasing.	B_I0
Some people considers that it is essential for government to take action to protect them.	E_I0
I also agree with this statement.	S_T0
Firstly , there are relatively substantial percent of animals are endangered when human is destroying animals habitats gradually.	S_M0
Therefore, it is neccessary for government to reduce the destroying and give endangered animals an appropriate and desirable place to live in.	B_S0
For example, a large number of parots are declined due to overindustralization.	I_S0
The industry and farmers require wood so that they cut down trees in the forest.	I_S0
Therefore, the forest become smaller and smaller beacuse of the demand  of raw materials.	I_S0
Then parots find that there is no habitat for them to live in so they will be disappeared.	E_S0
Secondly, the extinction of some particular sepcies of animals will affect the scientific research.	S_M0
In the report of TIMES ,   in the vicinity of 80 percent of  biological research are depend on some rare wildlifes .	B_S0
Those special lifes can not only provide scientific values ,  but also can be exhibitted in lots of museums.	I_S0
Due to the serious evironmental requirement, those animals can not fit in the social urban environment,  the extiction of them is a great lost for academic value.	E_S0
The last and most significant part is that  some not mining place stores a numerous kinds of natural resources.	S_M0
It was a pity if those resources are buried within the urban development .	S_S2
In various of research states that there are about 90 percent of natural resouces that have not been discoverd which sopphiscate the importance of prevent those wilderness areas from destruction.	S_M0
A large amount of coals, rare chemicals and rare metal are stored in the crust and lithosphere  .	B_S0
It 's hard to unearthe them .	I_S0
But it will be easy to dig them within the develop of insdustry skills.	E_S0
In conclusion , I take the view that it is significant for government to protect the wild animals and the habitats of them.	S_C2
 
In my opinion, I agree with the following statement.	S_T0
Because doing physical exercise will comsume the energy in your body, whatever you're strong or not, it's will always comseme energy.	S_T1
I think the best way is reading a book, because no matter what's kind of book you are read, it's just need you to read and understand the story or lecture, you don't need to focus on that, and if you are tired, you can close the book and relax.	S_M2
but doing phsical ecercise are not, it's will comsume your energy in your body, and sometimes, when people doing phsical exercise, they will feel more and more excited, and doing more physical exercise.	B_S1
If you want to sleep you can doing physical exercise, but if you want to relax, that not a good way.	E_S1
And also, wantching a movie maybe is a good way to relax, but it's also need you to focus on that, you need to remember what's that movie say and understand it, it's will let's u	O
 
In my opinion,this action is not such a good idea.	S_T0
Although your child had a very exellent score in one exam,you shouldn't to award him,becauce he is not studied for their parent,their are studied for themselves.	B_S0
if you want your children become more exellent,you must to let him knowyou are studing for yourselves.	I_S0
You studied hard is for your good life too many years ago.	E_S0
If you has got a high score.	S_M2
parents needs to tell their children you did a really good job.	B_S0
And parents could give them some thing to award them.	I_S0
Just like some thing to eat,some thing to play but not much money.	I_S0
The reason of do not give them monet that is they do not need money,though they have much money.	I_S0
They also do not have chance to pay it.	I_S0
if I am a father.	I_S0
I will pay for my children until they grown up,because this is my responsibility.	I_S0
My child do not have ability to manage their money.	I_S0
If you give them enough money to pay,they will not focus on their study.	I_S0
they will think about their mony and how to spend it.	I_S0
Parents award their children means to encourage them,to let them to get a higher score in the next examination.	I_S0
But if you give them some money to take them don not focus on,it will be not meaningful.	I_S0
Never let the child be thinking that I could get enough award before l work hard.	I_S0
you should let them know that study is a responsible things for you .	I_S0
Parents are not the money machine.	I_S0
They let you to study and to live luchily,so they all response for you,and there is the best environment to let you live and study.	I_S0
You must to study hard.	I_S0
They do not need proud for you good mark.	I_S0
And they do not need to take care of your study.	I_S0
They are just to do the things they are interested in.	I_S0
So they do not offer their child their money to let them do not focus.	E_S0
Childen should to know that they are studying for yourselves,but not their parents.	B_C0
They need to focus on their pesponsibility that is to sudy hard.	I_C0
It is for their future and their lives.	I_C0
All the children and parents should remember it.	E_C0
 
Have you ever seen that some people prefer to ask surrounding friends for help rather than turn to extended family members for help when they are in trouble?	B_I0
Some people in the society believe that all of the family members, including entended family members, are the most unique and significant people for everyone.	E_I0
When it comes to the opinion that extended family is less important nowadays than before, I strongly agree.	B_T0
There are three aspects that can help me to illustrate my prespective.	E_T0
First of all, with this society and individuals' lifestyle develop more and more rapidly, most of the person prefer to ask surrounding people for help when they have problems in order to solve the  trouble quickly.	S_M1
On the other hand, ask extended family for help is not a feasible way to solve the problem because they may cannot understand your situations.	B_S0
For instance, my brother liked to ask family members for help before because he throught family members would help him more efficiently.	I_S0
However, one day, after he ask his surpior for help, he realized that it is more efficient and direct way to solve the problem because he doesn't need to explain his situation to his surpior, like how he suffers this trouble and what result he wants to get.	E_S0
Moreover, in this society, many people are really far away from their extended family members.	S_M1
I mean many workers decide to remove to another city to develop nowadays and they won't meet other family menbers frequently.	B_S0
For example, my uncle's family used to live with my family together in the same city.	I_S0
However, he decided to go to another city which is more developed than my city.	I_S0
After he settled down to that city, we could not see each other frequently and our con	E_S0
 
Whatever we live in the past or now, there have been the incorrect information were publiced in our life; therefore, we can not definetely distingush the public information in which period are convincing.	S_I0
We can only compare the accuracy of the information between the past and now from the different aspects including the political, entertaning and the international news.	S_T1
In the first place, for the political events, the media are concerned about the accuracy all the time whatever in the past our now simply because the political events always are the sensitive and important information for the civilizations.	S_M0
It is known to all that the government's decisions are based on the civilization and the president is chosed by the inhabitants.	B_S0
Therefore, as a civilization, we should focus on the current political events all the time including the positive events and the negative events.	I_S0
Thus, the opposing status of the government will request the media to repot the ruler's behavior and the current decition since they need to mornitor the ruler's effects on the whole society.	I_S0
Therefore, the media has been concerned about the accuracy of the government's situation all the time since the competition between two opposing status are occur all the time.	E_S0
In the second place, when we foccus on the international news, we can find that the media always report some incorrect information.	S_M0
My onw experience can succcessifully illustrate this opinion, I alwas learn that there are lots of violation in the England including the race promblem and the salary problem from the international news.	B_S0
However, when I went to to England, I fund that what I learn from the international news is incorrect.	I_S0
I can feel the gental from the people htere and confortable and high-qualitied life there which are opposing to the TV.	I_S0
After that, I found I have been deceived all the time since the internal media always exagerately report the international news in order to destruct the appearence of the foreign world and let people feel that the internal country is better than others whatever in the past or now.	E_S0
In the third place, when we focus on the entertaning field, we will find that todays media is more concerded about the profit rather than accuracy than the past.	S_M0
The reason is simple because with the improvement of the life quality and the development of the commusing technology, people pay more attention on the famous individuals.	B_S0
This situation was never occured in the past.	I_S0
The frequency of the focus can bring lots of profits, which make the media nowadays always choose the brilliand and intersting of the individuals and they even make up the events.	I_S0
Furthermore, this kind of incorrect behavior will make the teenager absorb the negative impacts and loste themself in the future.	E_S0
To sup up, nowadays media should focus on the accuracy of the all public information simply because these information are widespred and meaningful for the civilazations nowadays	S_C2
 
Image the condition, now you are depressed to learn of your own illness, and the situation is not really optimistic, would you are willing to tell the truth about your state of your illness when your daughter try to figure out your realistic condition?	B_I0
It is likey that you are hesitant to answer the tricky question because you are reluctant to enbale her worries you.	I_I0
Seriously, at the moment your daughter attends the university entrance exam, you certainly don not tell the true dilemma.	E_I0
Therefore, in many embarressing situation, always speak out the truth is not necessary in any relationship between individuals.	S_T1
First of all, if you always tell others the truth, it will prone to result in a huge number of abysmal consequences.	S_M1
To illustrate, given the above exmaple, it is not uncommon to discover that the university entrance exam is extremely important in China, which serves as an indispensable role in every students' life.	B_S0
Therefore, when you tell your patient condition to your daughter, it seems like you are sincere and honest to your honey.	I_S0
However, it will make the troublesome affair like the girl feel frustrated, leading to fail in the exam, which is disadvantageous to her whole life for the sake of your truth.	E_S0
On top of that, there are many various other factors that is also important consideration in any relationship between people instead of telling the truth.	S_M1
For example, treating other people with respect is really necessary in any society.	B_S0
In this regard, many company will express terms that people are supposed to respect others.	I_S0
In addition, learing to listening your friends or parents's saying is indespensible during your interaction.	E_S0
To put all into a nutshell, I have the profound convition that it is not reasonable to always tell the truth ot thers.	S_C2
It is because there are other ways to bul	O
 
For many students,getting high grades needs much efforts.	B_I0
They need to be diligent both in class and after class  and never delay any homework.	I_I0
But after thrive to complete all the tasks above,what they get is only a mark on the test paper,which cannot bring them any entertainment.	I_I0
Thus students need mre reward for getting high marks, and giving them money is a good choice.	I_I0
First,having extra money tospend after performing well in exam will make students have  more passion on study.	I_I0
Take my own experience as an example.	I_I0
Last summer, my parents made a regulatin that if I get an “A” in the real analysis final exam, they will give me a fifty dollars asmy pocket money.	I_I0
Imagining that with fifty dollars I can hang out every where and buy whatever I like.	I_I0
So,I review what  Ihave learnt everyday after class,and often study late till night.	I_I0
Consequentially,I got full mark in the final test.	E_I0
Second,by doing so parents can teach students that they can only gain rewards after hard work.	S_M0
In one's childhood , he or she my often hear that his or her parents said "no pain ,no gain",but one cannot understand it better by being rewarded after hard work.	B_S1
when my brother was young, his parents often buy him a little gifts after he got a good mark.	E_S1
and later on he realized that it is because he had paid many effort in study that he gained the prizes.	S_M0
So he often pay much effort onwhatever he is doing.	S_S2
Third,parents can teach students how to gain and spend money by doing so.	S_M0
Take my teacher as an example ,he can always spend money correctly.	S_S2
 
In my country,a lot of parents choose to give money to their school-age children,but there also has some parents don't give money to their school-age children.	S_I0
When a child grow up to school-age,it will have some ability to make decision.	B_T0
In this time,parents can give some money to them,then they can buy the things what they want.	I_T0
With buy the things,they will getting better in make a dicision.	E_T0
On the other hand,school-age children are stay with their classmate everyday,there is no doubt that classmate will competive with each other.	S_M1
For example,if you haven't give your school-age child money,in the school,child will look at his friend buy food,drink and something else,he will be very upset because he haven't money to shopping with his friend,prehaps he will get the money by a worry way.	B_S1
So,I think it is important to give money to school children.	E_S1
However,some parents are worry about that if their children buy something useless like put money in the games.	S_M1
School-age children haven't a very good ability of make a dicision,but we can give school-age children 10 dollars a week,so they can control them to ues money,but not use it in something useless.	S_S2
In a word I think that parents should give money to school-age children,and this is undoubt good for the children.	S_C2
 
In this dog-eat-dog society, it is a prevaling phenomenon that students pay much more attention for their future major and even career.	B_I0
The issue on weather it is hard for morden people get successed compare to the past, especially for students, has never failed to arouse partents attentions.	I_I0
Some people hold the opinion that nowadays, people have no oppertunity to get succeed because of the development of the technology.	E_I0
I partly agree with this idea.	S_T1
However in most situations, I insist on an opposite viewpoint.	S_S2
First and foremost, people in present can easily search the information they want.	S_M2
Because of the internet, people can do some researches on the tendence of the job and the salary.	B_S0
So they can esaily to choose their further major base on these informations.	I_S0
For example, more and more company invest a large quantity of money in the computer program-development.	I_S0
So in the further, those company will hire more and more poeple which are major in compuratur science course.	I_S0
So the take computer science as a major is a good choic which cna lead a secure future.	I_S0
However in the past, people can only get the information base on the newspaper.	I_S0
So it is hard for them to get useful infromaions from the newspaper because usually the private date like the money their earn never publish.	E_S0
Furthermore, nowadays the technology give more opportunity for people to get a successful further.	B_C1
There are lots of new type of job which not presented in the past.	E_C1
For example, in the past, there is no job is relative to the internet or even electronic devices.	S_S2
But nowada	O
 
From time to time, people are facing with various difficulties that they have to overcome.	S_I0
The young generations nowadays are required to cultivate various abilities to be more competitive in modern society.	S_T1
Lately, an interesting discussion arises concerning whether it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize or not.	B_T0
In my opinion, I believe that the young generation should have the planning and organizing abilities.	E_T0
First of all, the ability to plan and organize could lay a solid foundation for the young generation's future.	S_M0
After getting a position in a company, there is no doubt that the young people have to deal with huge amouts of works.	B_S0
If they could divide various problems and give the first priority to the most important problem, they are able to accomplish their work more efficiently.	I_S0
Thus, they could be more competitive than the other people who don't own such a ability in their company.	I_S0
As a result of this, we should value the ability of planning and organizing.	E_S0
Second, the young generation could make full use of their time by mastering this ability.	S_M0
Compared to the adults, the young people's time is relatively free today.	B_S0
Therefore, in order to use their time efficiently, it is necessary for them to cultivate this ability.	I_S0
Having known what the young generations should do from Monday to Friday by making a good schedule, they could know their tasks clearly and get themselves relaxed, thus making them accomplishing their study more efficiently.	I_S0
In this way, this ability is significant for the young generations in modern society.	E_S0
Third, a good sense of planning and organzing could boost the development of leadership.	S_M0
A good leader needs the characteristics of planning and organizing skills.	B_S0
They have to orginze the group well in order to accomplish an important project or just encourage members to work efficiently.	I_S0
With the well organization, the group member could know what they are doing and what they should do in the next step.	I_S0
And a well-prepared plan merely helps group to avoid the emergency.	I_S0
Thus, it can enhance the ability of leadership.	E_S0
In a nutshell, I hold the opinion that it is essential to own the ability to plan and organize.	B_C1
It is not only because the young people can make full use of their time and lay a good foundation for their future, but also because it could cultivate the characteristics of leadership.	E_C1
 
Mistakes are always unavoiable, especially for young kids.	S_I0
When confronting with the question whether parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their mistakes, different people has different ideas.	S_T1
From my perspective, it is parents' responsibility to tolerate childen's mistke and lead them to learn from it.	S_T0
And my reasons are listed below.	S_T1
Firstly, making mistakes is a good way to learn.	S_M0
Young kids are always naugty and sometimes too young to get the hang of some sophisticated knowledge or lessons.	B_S0
However, obviously it is easy for them to make mistakes.	I_S0
So leading them to learn from their own mistkes will teach them to provoke on their behavior and help them calm down to think about what is right and what is wrong.	I_S0
When I was young, I had difficulty in finishing my schoolwork in time.	I_S0
My parents forced me to summarize reasons for unability to finish my assignment such as playing for too long or not being familiar with the knowledge.	I_S0
And gradually, I could finish my work on time.	I_S0
Had my parents pushed me to finish my work, I might hated my assignment and never done it ever.	I_S0
From my example, we knew that letting kids learn from their own mistakes will better their ability of learing from their mistakes.	E_S0
Secondly, granting children's mistake will relieve their pressure on making mistakes.	S_M0
Parents should not only help kid with their academic perfromance but also help them with their life lesson.	B_S0
As is wide acknowledged that making mistakes is human nature and we shouldn't afraid of making mistakes from which we can learn and make progress.	I_S0
If parents scold their kids for their wrongdoings evertime, kids would be less confident of himself.	I_S0
My friend used to be frightened at speaking publically, and with my help he foud that the reason lied in the behavior of his parents.	I_S0
Everytime he made mistakes, his parents would show their disappointment towards him and thus he was inclinend to keep his mouth shut in public.	I_S0
It is of great importance that parents should tolerate their kids' mistake since they should teach their kids the right attitude against wrongdoings.	E_S0
Of course, letting kids make mistakes doesn't mean that parents just see their kids make mistakes and do nothing more.	S_M0
Youngsters need high-quality education too build up their views about the whole universe and the value.	B_S1
Therefore, parents should encourage kids to look back and reflect on their wrongdoings rather than spoil them by granting all their mistakes or saying nothing about their mistakes.	E_S1
As an old saying goes,'Failure is the mother of success'.	B_C0
Kids should be tolerated to make mistaked and adopt a positive attitude towards their mistakes.	I_C0
Also, youngsters should be encouraged to learn from his or her mistakes by his or her own, for they can learn quicker and better.	E_C0
 
It is difficult for a parent to just sit back and allow their child to make  a mistake.	B_I0
Many parents go out of their own way to protect their children from everything that are not fitted to them.	I_I0
However, at some point part of being a good parent is letting go and watching them move through the unfamiliar reigon and make mistakes.	E_I0
No matter how much they want to help their children , they need to have the freerdom to make mistakes and to learn from them.	S_T1
Erros  and mistake in the trials could be the greatest lessons.	S_M1
Children experience the things that they are not turning well for them.	B_S0
These experiences will leave a lasting impression on childeren abd they will learn to mmake good choices and avoid making the same mistake in the furture.	I_S0
When I was in my middle school, one dy i forgot to bring my course work and i needed it it in order to hand in after the class.	I_S0
So I made a phone call to my mother and ask her to bring my homework to school but  my mother said that bringing homewerk to school is your own responsibility.	I_S0
I got the  criticize from the teacher but Iearned a lesson form that and since then I always wrote down the important things I need to do in the following stpes on a notebook and put it my schollbag in case I forget.	E_S0
What's more , perhaps the best way to develop the children's creativity  is to ask them to stop being afraid of making  mistakes.	S_M1
What  mistakes do is offer us the opptunity to explore beyond where we thought we were gong with-- the introduce  that rare element of the chance into our work.	B_S0
The people  In conclusion , if we want our children to develop a sense of respionsibility, make good choices and become more ddaring and creative, we have to let go and allow them to makwe mistakes.	I_S0
After all, parents cannot protect their kids forever; eventually vchildren need to learn to live their own live.	E_S0
 
Recently, more and more companies and enterprises appear, and in this kind of cooperations ,a leader is needed.	B_I0
Besides, not in companies, but in schools, there are still leaders, such as monitors in a class, and even in our home, there still leaders who make the final decision.	I_I0
Leaders seem to be common but plays an important role, so what kind of person is potential to be a leader and are their characters naturally born?	E_I0
As far as I am concerned, the leadship is not instinct but can be  learned.	S_T0
My belief will be supported by the follow reasons.	S_T1
Firstly, human beings are not born with good qualities which are potential for us to be leader.	S_M0
To the contrary, we learned everything from our environment,such as our parents, teachers and even strangers.	B_S0
For we know nothing when we are born except crying, our characters are molded in family, school and society.	I_S0
For example, we all know nothing when we are first come to the world, but later we become different person and play different role in the society.	E_S0
Secondly, the powering of learning is quite strong that we can not ignore.	S_M0
To illustrate, my neighorhood, Mary, who is at the same age as me, she is not clever and when in group working, she is always the one falls behind us, there is no dout that she is not clever enough to be a leader in our group.	B_S0
But Mary believes that if she keeps learning that she can make progress, so she is always the first one to come to school and the last one to leave school, she reads various books and always practice delivering speech before a mirror.	I_S0
Finally,at the end of this symester, we also had a final group working, and Mary made a good speech and later she was appointed to be the leader of our group.	E_S0
Although some people believes that leadship is naturally born, they have wisdom, bravery,and good ability to organize from their instinct, other people will have no chance to become a leader from learning, In my opinion, I firmly believe that we can learn to be a leader, because the good qualities for a leadship can be learned, what we need to do is to push ourselves and take action.	S_M0
To sum up, from my examples, I strongly think people can learn to be a leader, for we are born equal, we make progress through learning ,and also learning can play a pivotal role in our life.	S_C2
 
In the wake of technology's development, workers, nowadays, have many different types of takes to deal with at workplace.	B_I0
Some people claims that they like to do similar tasks for a long time, others aruges that doing different types of tasks won't get bored.	I_I0
From my perspective, it is better to face with different types of tasks during the workday.	E_I0
My reasons and details are listed following.	S_T1
To start with, dealing with various assignments don't make people bored easily.	S_M1
The similar tasks are desiccated as you repeat the same routin again and agian.	B_S0
A salient example can be seen in study.	I_S0
when I prepared for TOFEL, I had to study English all day long, even sometimes I worked with reading all day.	I_S0
It really drived me crazy, and I felt exausted.	I_S0
Compared to similar tasks, different types of tasks make a great difference.	I_S0
For instance, I can studied English in the morning and learnt biology afternoon.	I_S0
Therefore, I can switch my mind in different subjects, and still fouce on study.	E_S0
Another relevant reason used to support my opinion is that different types of tasks can make sure employees stay competitive.	S_M1
Unlike the similar tasks, the same process won't bring about new problems, an the workers can get any progerss.	B_S0
A variety of jobs means that you have to proficient in differet areas, which requres workers contribute more energy to their jobs.	I_S0
The workers have to face with different problmes.	I_S0
As a result they will take up more challenges, and stay competive in business.	E_S0
Take into account all the factors above, we can safely draw the conclusion.	B_C1
Diffrent types fo tasks bring about more challenges and enable workers to keep competitive.	E_C1
 
Nowadays many people like famous entertainers and athletes.	B_I0
They know what their idol like, where their live even what their eat for last meal.	I_I0
Some people suggest that we should leave more privacy to famous entertainers and athletes.	E_I0
I totally agree with them.	S_T0
At first, I think more privacy can make famous entertainers and athletes have a beter daily life.	S_M0
For example, we all know some famous men wear huge sun glasses and big hats when they go out even in hot summer.	B_S0
Beacuse they do not want to be noticed by thier fans.	I_S0
I think if their fans leave more privacy to them, like do not ask for photo when they meet famous people in the street.	I_S0
Famous entertainers and athletes are able to spend less time dealing with their  fans and pay more attitude to their own life.	E_S0
On the other hand, if famous entertainers and athletes have more privacy, they fans will have more time to do more important things.	S_M0
I have taken the same train with a famous singer.	B_S0
When the train arriving at the station, there hundreds of his fan waitting in the station to just have a look.	I_S0
Someone of them asked  a day off to get here and some even come from other cities.	I_S0
If they do not know taht the singer will take this train, they may do more important things like working or studying at that day.	E_S0
Although some people may say they are willing to know more about  the daily life of famous entertainers and athletes they like.	S_M0
But I think people love a singer because of his song not beacuse of what he do during his daily, people love a athletes because of his present in gym instead of what he eats for meal.	B_S0
There is a saying that no one would hate a book because of the writor is not good at cooking.	I_S0
Without knowing famous entertainers and athletes's private life, people will still love them.	E_S0
Famous entertainers and athletes show the best of their life in gym or singing hell.	B_C0
And in other parts of their life, they can do everything if they like.	I_C0
Famous entertainers and athletes deserve to have more privacy than they have now.	E_C0
 
As for me, I do think it is wise to give kids money because of high marks that they get in school.	B_T0
There are three main reasons involved.	E_T0
In the first place, there is no denying that giving the kids money as reward for excellent academic performances is a good way of showing recogonition to them, which will get them informed that their parents are proud of what they have done.	B_S0
Take me as an example, my parent used to give me money every time I did good in an exam.	I_S0
That meaned a lot to me because I can to know that my parents cared me and they were happy to see what I achieved.	I_S0
I also considered it as a form of communication bewteen my parents and me.	E_S0
In addition to that, under no circumstances can we underestimate the importance of motivation too much.	S_M1
And it is universally acknowledged that the reward like money perfectly plays the role of a motivator and will enable kids to strive for good grades in exams.	B_S0
You know sometimes kids will get tired of parents' countless speeches about the importance of study and that is the reason why we need to promise some reward to stimulate them.	I_S0
And this can even create a positve circle.	I_S0
Suppose that a kid gets some money for the good grade in one exam, and it is very likely that the kid will try harder  in order to keep the good grade so that more money can be achieved.	I_S0
So kids might fulfill their potentials if the circle develope.	E_S0
Last but not least, It can also build up the concept that you will be amply rewarded only if you work hard and stand out.	S_M1
This is of vital importance in their following life.	B_S0
Just like the saying goes 'You reap what you sow'.	I_S0
By giving kids money for good mark, they can easily come to the conclusion that they will be rewarded because they behave well.	I_S0
And they will aspire to behave well to get rewarded.	E_S0
So as what have been illustrated above, I absolutely believe that it is beneficial for parents to give kids money as reaward for their good grades.	S_C2
 
Rencently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether success is important, or it is more important to remain happy and optimistic when you fail?	B_I0
As far as I am concerned, remaining happy and optimistic is more important.	E_I0
My points can be elaborate as follows.	S_T1
To begin with, remaining happy and optimistic can give people constantly motivation to succeed.	S_M2
To be more specific, no one can always succeed and every one will face failure.	B_S0
People will have confidence and motivation to succeed again when they fail, if they can remain happy and optimistic.	I_S0
This is because optimitic and happy will make people think that they have not lose any thing even they failed.	I_S0
However, if people cannot remain happy and optimistic, they might lose their confidence and motivation to succeed again.	I_S0
For example, I failed to run for the monitor of my class.	I_S0
But I remained happy and optimitic because I thought there still some classmates who supported me.	I_S0
Then I had the motivation to improve myself and tried to run for the monitor next year.	I_S0
Finally, I became the new monitor.	I_S0
If I cannot ramain any happy and optimistic, I would not try it again and then I would never be a monitor.	E_S0
To be followed, remaining happy and optimistic when people fail can easily help people get out of the troubles.	S_C2
To illustrate, when people failed, what they need to do is to find the way getting out of the trouble.	B_S0
If they remained happy and optimistic, they will be positive and start to think how to get them out of the troubles.	I_S0
However, if they cannot remain happy and optimistic, they will be negative and stop thinking anything.	I_S0
Thus they might always in troubles and they cannot be successful.	E_S0
For instance, when I failed, I always thought something happy and tried my best to find the way out of the troubl	O
 
Make Mistakes And Learn From It	S_S2
In my opinion, I agree with that parents should allow the children to do what they want enen if they may make miatakes and let them learn from it by themselves.	S_T0
First, parents can't protect the children for a hole life.	S_M1
They will deal with someting like familays, study, jobs by themselves in time.	B_S0
So the earlier they make mistakes, the better they can associate with the society.	I_S0
Secondly, if the children make mistakes, they can remember it for a long time.	I_S0
While if the parents just let them to do the things as what they were told, they can't remember anything envn they are correct.	I_S0
Thirdlty, if they learn from the mistake and really understand it, the can deal with the samiliar things by their own.	I_S0
Finally, as a teenager, we are born to win.	I_S0
Grasping the chance and doing what we want is not only our choice, but our duty.	I_S0
To be a standard society number, we are suppose to improve our ability and face the difficute.	I_S0
For example, I further my study far away from my home for a long time.	I_S0
My parents just concern about me without helping me, hoping I can deal with the difficute whether they are beside me.	I_S0
Fortunately, just due to the mistakes I ever made and the experience I get from it, I become a man, not a child anymore.	E_S0
On the other hand, if the child were protected by the parents, by the schools, by the goverment, they can't associated with the society.	S_M1
Even they may become shy and don't would like to make friends with others.	B_S1
As a result, they can't become the future of the country, but the one should be taken care of.	I_S1
So, as I suggest, the advantages outweigh the disadvantage.	I_S1
To improve our ability and to take on the duty of the future, parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.	E_S1
Only by dealing with the mistakes and learning from it, can they grow.	S_C2
 
Nowadays,many peple are facing the heavy stress,so it is importing for them to relax.	S_T1
This leads to a question:which way should them choose in order to relax themselvs.	S_T0
Some people believes that watching tv or reading a book is a better way than doing  physical exercises, while other believe that dong sports or other outdoor activities is better than watching tv programs or rading a book.	S_T1
From my perspective, I belives that doing physical exercises is a more efficient way of relaxing ourselves.	S_M0
One of the most important reason is that while we are taking physical exercises , we release our stress we gained from studyng or something else.	B_S1
Although it may make us feel tired after doing the exercises ,it is more helpful than watching tv or reading books because when we are under big pressure , we may not have the mood to watch tv or read book, sometimes it can be worse if we read book or watch tv.	E_S1
Another reason why  doing physical exercisesis a better way is that while we are releasing our stress , our bodies are also exercising themselves,we will be healthier and will be well perpared for the futher study.	S_M0
When we choose watching tv or reading books, maybe it can helps to change our bad mood,but we can easily be addicted to it and will forget about the time.	B_S0
We may spen a lot of time reading books or watching tv,it is harmful to our eyes.	I_S0
As we all know , eyes are the windows of mind,it is very important for not only our studies, but also our lives.	E_S0
In addition, doing physical exercises may lead us tobe more outgoing ,while we exercise our bodies, we also exercise our characterstic.	S_M0
We may meet people who are also interested in the same thing.	B_S0
While doing the things, you can share whether your sadness or happiness with them,and you will reduce the stree .	I_S0
You will be less stressful than before.	E_S0
All in all , it is my understanding that doing physical canleading to a much more efficient way to relax ourselvesthrough a big pressure or a sad things.	B_C1
I think more peope should take physical exercises.	E_C1
 
According to the nowadays lifestyle, I support that it is better to relax by wathing a movie or reading a few books compared to do physical exercise.	B_I0
Lots of people have to work from almost eight in the morning till six in the afternoon.	E_I0
This phenomenone makes me doubt whether they really have spare energy to do physical exercise.	S_T1
Firstly, I doubt that people have spare energy to do physicial exercise after they finsh the whole day working tasks.	S_M1
Although physical exercise is a good way to keep fit and healthy, it needs lots of energy and persistance to hold on like everyday.	B_S0
I don't view this kind of activity as a relax.	I_S0
It actually a burden for plenty of people.	I_S0
In the meanwhile, watching a movie or reading a book is a lot more relax than exercise.	I_S0
It should be a great picture if you will image that sitting in a chair outside the yards with a cup of a hot tea and hold your ipad or an acutal book.	E_S0
Secondly, I think a movie or a book will contain a lot more knowledge and can help me to absorb something that I can not learn from my own experience which is the exercise can not offer me.	S_M1
For instance, I love the movie the Independant Day which described a war between alien species and human beings.	B_S0
It taught me that I should always have hope with everything especially when I face a difficulty or a challenge.	I_S0
Watching a movie and reading a book are not only help me relax myself but also drive me to think more dimensionly.	E_S0
All in all, I admitted that physical exercise is good for all of us but it should be the better way to relax when it comes to watching a movie or reading a book.	B_C0
On the one hand, people do not have enough time and energy to stick on the physicial exercise.	I_C0
On the other hand, watching a movie or reading a book can bring us more experience to live better and relax us both from physics aspect and mental aspect.	E_C0
 
Which kind of  working styles do the workers prefer?	B_I0
A job with a myriad of assignments which require numerous professional skills and technologies, or an monotonous work simply repeat what have been hundreds of times before?	E_I0
As far as I am concerned, a job with quantities of tasks is a better choice since it can provide us more chance to imporve our abilities as well as endow a possibility to the promotion in the future.	B_T0
All these benefits will lead to a satisfaction for the worker eventually.	E_T0
Recent years have seen the rapid growth in both fields of economy and culture.	S_M0
A worker who can only do the similar jobs will not catch up with the pace of development.	B_S0
Massive of all-rounded elites are needed on all fields of the industry.	I_S0
So if the assignment is comprised of several tasks in different field can be conducive to employees as they can cultivate nurmerous abilities in diiferent subjects.	I_S0
By learning all these kind of technologies, people can feel a sense of achievement in their position, which the essential part of the satisfaction.	E_S0
When i was in the school lab, I feel this sense of achievement myself by obtaining several distinguished skills myself.	S_M0
When finshed assignment given by my professors, i learned how to put the theory I learned in teatbook into practice as well as how addressed the problems myself.	B_S1
By the end of the task, I acquire a lot of experience and skills which lead to a successful essay.	E_S1
Also, a man with skills can always be popoular in a enterprise, thus makes it is certain that he will get a promotion in the future.	S_M0
A brighter future i career always means a better income.	B_S0
Working with tasks can be a promoter to this future achievement.	I_S0
And if we have such decent payment, the satisfation of the job will increase without hesitation.	E_S0
For example, a man with high salary can always be happy at work because he know  he will have the money for their children and parents.	B_S1
But a worker who struggles to make the ends meet will  be upset all the time.	E_S1
In conclusion, a job with more tasks is more satisfactory because it can promote us a bright future and professional skills.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, the society is generated a bad penomenom, because everyone is less friendly than before.	S_I0
Every generation is changing.	B_T1
So I think people tday are more relucant to help the stuggling strangers.	E_T1
First and formost, people nowadays are just concentrate on themselves.	S_M0
When you walk on the street, you will find the white collars who walk like wind without stopping in any seconds.	B_S0
They just care about the coffee on their hands, the documents in their bags, the money they will earn from any cases they handle.	I_S0
They have no time and no awareness to pay attention the strangers passing by.	I_S0
They are very utility, just focusing on money.	I_S0
To illustrate, recently I am doing a reserch concening about companies.	I_S0
By doing this, I find that the bound between companies is very fragile.	I_S0
Only when the contrast has a direct benefit to the company, the crews of the company who is resiponsible for this case will agree.	I_S0
If the profits are not great, they will turn their back on this assocites.	I_S0
They are indifferent to their partners, not metion what they want to do to the struggling strangers.	E_S0
Moreover, the distrust in this society become more and more apprant but in the past the situation is completely different.	S_M0
Prior to the past, every individual is willing to help others when they are in hot water.	B_S0
People in that time not only consider this help as accumulating virtue and merit but also gain the happiness and a sense of satisfation from doing this.	I_S0
I remembered when I was at the age of five, I was playing with my cousin in a narrow lane.	I_S0
We went on the random having a lot of fun but were interrupted by a strong dog suddenly appearing.	I_S0
I was so afraid that I escaped quickly leaving my younger brother alone.	I_S0
When I looked back, at that second, I thought I would never have a chance to see him agian.	I_S0
But adversely, a stranger who was strong and powerful rushed over there bitting the dog and scared the dog away.	I_S0
I was so apperictate for saving my brother's life.	I_S0
Even though I had never seen him afterwards I still remembered that scene and whenever I recall this event, I will feel thankful and warm.	E_S0
Adimittedly, there are still some people are willing to give a hand to these strangers.	S_M0
But you should notice that it will be very small protion in all society.	B_S1
Even the young children who have kind hearts are told to not to approch the poeple who is looked to need help because their parents think this kinds of person will be harmful to their children.	E_S1
In coculusion, I suggest that people are indiff	S_S2
 
Did you make your decisions all the time?	B_I0
Have you argued with your parents because you did not like the decision the they made for you?	I_I0
This time I always make my own decision bh mydelf.	I_I0
When I was twelve, I began to reject the decision that my parents made for me.	E_I0
Thereby, I agree that young people are better able to make decision about their own lives.	S_T0
There is a couple of specific facets why I think in this way.	S_S2
Initially, technology makes chance for nowadays young people to communicate with the whole world.	S_M1
Modern young people attain more and more knowadge from internet.	B_S0
They can solve probelms in their live by asking people around the world.	I_S0
However, young people in the past may just can ask their parents or raletives for help.	I_S0
For instance, I planned to travel my county in my holidy.	I_S0
I did research on the internet.	I_S0
I booked tickets on the internet and accounted my budget with my computer.	I_S0
I even have not had a talk with my parents.	I_S0
In the last, I just report my budget and my plan to them.	I_S0
They think I am already to make my own decision and agree my plan happily.	I_S0
Nevertheless, young people in the past, such as my grandparents, cannot do research and make plan by usiong the computer.	I_S0
This is because the computers were not universal.	I_S0
They could not book tickets without arriving the station and found.	E_S0
Moreover, today young people spend less time with their parents than young people did in the past.	S_M1
Nowadays, young people spend more time with their classmates.	B_S0
When they meet problems, parents are not the only people we can ask help for.	I_S0
We become more and more independent.	I_S0
For example, when I was twelve, I choose to go back from bejing	E_S0
Even though parents think they need to make crutical decision for us to halp us save time and energy.	B_C0
But I still think that even though we make a wrong decidion, we would like to be much more mature.	I_C0
Taking all the factors mentioned above, we may safely arrive the conclusion that today young people are better able to make their own decision about their lives.	E_C0
 
In the future, all of us may enter the class and join numbers of meetings and class disscussions.	S_T1
Commonly, the teacher would not always agree with our own views at class, they may cast doubt on our opinions.	S_T0
I believe the right thing to do at that time is to wait until the class or the meeting is over and communicate with the person directly about the problem.	B_T1
The reasons are as followed.	E_T1
To start with, it might be thought as an interruption when you correct your personal mistake at class.	S_M0
Specifically, it's disrecpectful to the teacher and other students who are still concentrating to the class.	B_S0
You can't just stand out and talk about your misunderstanding when the class is running, it might interfere with the teacher's teaching strategy and affect the whole class's studying efficiency.	I_S0
Waiting until the last minute to talk with the teacher privately is a wiser choice since it won't cause conflict with the whole class and everyone could still get a satisfactory result.	E_S0
Moreover, connecting with the person after everything has been done could show one's positive attitude.	S_M0
Think if you just talk to the teacher directlyat class without reconsiderate what the best answer is or do nothing, the teacher might feel disappointed and won't appreciate you because of your discouraging attitude.	B_S1
But on the other hand if you contack with the teacher after school, the teacher would praise you for your willing to study and that might come up with the best result .	E_S1
Finally, getting along with the teacher could help you learn more from the teacher and improve on your performance.	S_M0
When talking with the teacher primately without being interrupted, you can even learn extra knowledge form the teacher to broaden your aspect and get better grades in the campus.	B_S0
For instance, the teacher might tell you some key points about how to get higher marks at test or share some effective strategies of taking notes with you.	I_S0
He wouldn't mention these things at class, but he could tell you these in this simple conversation.	I_S0
These stategies would be extremely useful to get a better performance in your future syudy.	E_S0
In conclusion, the benifits of connecting with the teachr after school are not interrupting the class, talk efficiently and get extra help	S_C2
 
In my opinion,watching a movie or reading a book is better to relax than doing physical exercise.	S_T0
First of all,people always tired about their feeling .	B_T1
They need to relax about their thinking and go out of their mind so do something like watching a movie is a good way can let people escape from the bad mood.	E_T1
Another way is that doing physical exercise may let you feel more tired because of you give out lots of energy and lose lots of water.	S_M2
According this watching a movie or reading a book in home is a better way.	B_S2
All in all,i would better to watch a movie or read a book at home than relax by doing physical exercise.	E_S2
 
Never in the history has a problem of making decisions been such sailent than today.	B_I0
With the sociaty becoming increasingly complex, there are many choice for the youg to chose.	E_I0
However, many parents want to help their children to decide the way.	B_T1
Some calims children in the past are more depende on waht thier parents say than children in today.	E_T1
Personally skeaking, I diagree bout that.	S_S2
Fristly, the tecnology is more well-developed, and the children have more appliance and wesibe to help them  with the decisions.	S_M0
What's more, the people in the website have more expercinence and experiment have help you.	B_S1
However, the parents may be not up-to-date, and they can not have the last news, and their decision may be not apporperble.	E_S1
Secondly, the idea or the tast of your parent may be too diffrenet whith you.	S_M0
Your parents had lots of experience which is too differents from yours, so the taste and ideas will be totally different.	B_S1
Thereby, they can not understand your situation so that they can not use the best decision, or the decisions they made may be not fit to you.	E_S1
Atimitly, the parents are the close people in our life, and we must trust them.	S_M0
However, when your parents give you a decision you can just compare with your idea and get the covered one to act.	B_S1
If you dont't want your parents to help you with, you can just take their advice.	E_S1
we must trust our parents, but sometims the parents' decision is no the best one.	B_C1
At this time, we can not follow them mindlessly.	E_C1
 
When you are tired, the first thing that comes up in your mind  propably is watching a movie or reading a book.	B_I0
What about doing physical exercise?	E_I0
For me, it will be the last thing that I will willing to do as a relaxation.	S_T0
The man who would do excercise rather than watching or reading may argue that physical exercise can make your body fit.	S_M2
After all, doing physical exercise regularly is a healthy lifestyle.	B_S0
However, we can not ignore the fact that we just want some rest instead of excersice.	I_S0
In my opinion, the meaning of rest is to doing thins with ease and pleasure.	I_S0
The physical excercise just failed to match any of them.	I_S0
reading and wacthing a movie are the better way to realx.	E_S0
Watching a movie or reading a book has two considerable merits.	S_C2
For one thing, you can spend more time with your family or friends during the relaxing time.	B_S0
you can watch a film with your family members and maybe have a chat about life or job.	I_S0
this will not only make you relax, but also improve the relationship with your family.	I_S0
For another thing, amovie or a book will give you a insight of some brand new things.	I_S0
Therefore, you will see things from more objective persepectives.	I_S0
In short, they will make you wise.	E_S0
 
Currently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: would people spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.	B_I0
Opinions vary from person to person.	I_I0
Some claim that people would defintely spend less time cooking and preparing food and pay more attention to their work.	E_I0
However, i would hold an oppsite view that it is much more possible for people to focus on their cooking and food.	B_T0
My point can be elaborated as follows.	E_T0
First, in the next twenty years, people will pay much more attention on their own health, which is influenced by what they eat in their daily life.	S_M1
The research has showed that the development of food science in the future is providing people healthier and more delicious food.	B_S0
In next twenty, there will be more people realizing the importance of food to their health.	I_S0
They would like to spend more time for cooking their own healthy food by themselves from the deep heart.	I_S0
My major is food science and technology and i know that the ways to cook play an extremely important role to  make food healthy.	I_S0
You spend 50mintute heating an egg will lead the egg white transform to a different formation, which may be harmful for huamn's body.	I_S0
However, if you just heat it at a proper time, you can make sure that the egg white proteins can be health and absorbed easily by human.	E_S0
Second, the technology is developing at a dramatic speed, which may contributes less job for people to do, as a result, people would have more free time to cook for themselves and spend time on preparing food.	S_M1
Many people have believed that in some fields that human will be replaced by robots and people could have more free time on their own, which means they have to do something by their own instead of using robots to help them.	B_S0
My grandfather has retired for a long time and he is always boring in the daily life.	I_S0
In this suitation, he starts to learn how to cook meal for his grandson, my little cousin.	I_S0
This example shows that people really have to do something by their own instead of others so that they feel comfortable and normally, cooking food is a nice choice.	E_S0
In summary, from what has been discussed above, we can safely draw a conclusion that spending more time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years could be a reality.	S_C2
 
The reward for students' score has been highly debatable.	B_T1
There is a controversy that parents should give the money as the reward for their children's high mark.	E_T1
From my point of view, I Think parents should give the money as the reward.	S_T0
First, this reward can encourage students to study hard and get high score.	S_M0
Since children desire to get money to buy what they like, if the parents offer money by this way, their children will try their best to pursue this.	B_S0
For example, my uncle wants my brother to study hard , and my brother want to by a new bike.	I_S0
Then my uncle anounced that if my brother can get high score, my uncle can buy a new bike for him.	I_S0
After that, my brother make his effert to preview and review the kwonledge and do much additional assignment.	I_S0
In his final examination, he got a very high grades,and he got the new bike.	I_S0
Therefore, this method is effective.	E_S0
Second, this reward can help children to excercise the money management.	S_M0
Because this kind of process is like the relationship between the employer and the employee.	B_S0
Childrens earn money through high score and the parents get satisfactory result.	I_S0
Then the children can dispose these money freely.	I_S0
Whether to save for a big purchasing or to use right away.	I_S0
It depends.	I_S0
When they grows up they will be able to manage their money easier.	E_S0
Third, this method can make the children kwon that earn money need to pay much effort.	S_M0
Because they should study harder  , and then  they can get high score.	B_S0
If they do not make their  effort , it is almost impossible to get high score and get the reward.	I_S0
For example, I used to play computer games and not study hard ,I think it  is very comfortable ,then I got bad score in the examination.	I_S0
As the result, I can not got the money from my parents.	E_S0
To sum up, I think parents give money as the reward for their children for their high score is an effective method.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, many people think that comparing to the previous,it's too difficult to educate kids.	S_I0
I agree with that, because with the development of  the technology there are many fantastic things that will distract children's attention.	S_T0
Therefor, it is difficult for chilren to study quietly.	S_T1
Firstly, in the past, the internet was not developed, and children had nothing to play, so they would listen to their parents' words and stady hard.	S_M1
However, nowadays, with the popularity of the internet, children canget in touch with more new things on the internet like computer games and chat with zhe social networking web sites.	B_S1
Children's extra-curricular life becames richer, and if they have more views about themselves they will no longer listen to their parents.	E_S1
Secondly, traditionaly, the economy was not particularly developed, the function of the cell phone is limited to the ring up.	S_M1
Even though,  mobile phones are still very expensive, But in the present days, the economic are developing.	B_S1
So almost everyone has a cell phone the mobile phone functions are developed rapidly, people can not only make phone calls but also play games on it.	E_S1
 
Nowadays cooking has been a concern for many people and it causes a topic that whether people will spend less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.	S_T1
This debate divides people into different camps with opposite opinions, and some people would like to hold th opinion that people will spend less time cooking in twenty years than they do today, however, I consider people will cook more in twenty years, and there are some reasons and exmaples that can illustrate my opinions.	S_T0
First and foremost, in twenty years, people will begin to care more about their health.	S_M1
To be more specific, people will focus on their health more as the technique and the society develop for twenty years,  so people begin not to trust the food outside and begin to choose the food and cook the food by themselves.	B_S0
In opposition, people nowadays have very few time to focus on their health and all they think is making money, so they will not spend their time on cooking food.	I_S0
For example, twenty years later, there are more and more people caring about their health and willing to spend time and energy on that, so everyday after work, they will go to a supermarket and buy some organic food and vegetables, then cook on their own to eat healthily in order to improve their health.	E_S0
In the second place, people will have more time free in twenty years which allows them to cook food.	S_M1
This is because as the technique continue to develop in twenty years, people will enjoy more high-technique quipments such as auto-driving, and this can not only help people improe their life quality, but also allow them to have more time for resting, so they can just have more time for cooking and preparing food themselves.	B_S1
In opposition, nowadays people still have to a lot of things on their own such as driving or supervising a factory which requires them to be quite busy and have no time for them to relax or do something they enjoy, so they won't have much cahnces to cook on their own.	E_S1
Granted, it may be reasonable and attractive that some people claim that people will spend less time cooking and preparing food in twenty years than they do today.	B_C0
People today have more healthier food sources so people will prefer cooking themselves since the environment day has less pollutions than the environment in twenty years.	I_C0
However, this can not hold water, since after twenty years, people will begin to care about the environmnet even more since the people are getting a better education in twenty years, so the food sources will be even healthier that can attract more people to cook on their own.	I_C0
So I am still convinced by my standpoint that people will spend more time cooking in twenty years than they do today.	E_C0
 
I am convinced that watching a movie or reading a book is a better way than doing phisical exercise to relax myself.	B_T0
My reason for my opinion is as follows.	E_T0
First of all, watching a movie and reading a book not only releases my pressure but also enables me to learn some knowledge which can not be studied in class.	S_M0
Instead, dong phsical exercise can only build up my body and make me feel stronger.	B_S1
For example, After watching the Shawshank Redemption I learn that we must keep our faith and keep going on matter what bad condition we are faced.	E_S1
Secondly, watching a movie and reading a book is not exhausting while doing phsical exercise may uses up your energy and leaves you a tired body.	S_M0
In other words, watching a movie and reading a book does not have negative effects to your following work but doing phsical exercise take some time to have rest.	B_S1
As for me, on one day about two years ago, I went to the gym, worked out a lot and I had a terrible spirit the next day.	E_S1
The last thing I have to admit is that doing Phisical exercise does have its own advantange over watching a movie and reading a book.	S_M0
Doing phsical exercise wll keep you fit while the other choice may make you fat.	B_S0
However watching a movie and reading a book has more advantages than The other alternative.	I_S0
In conclusion ,	E_S0
 
As new electric age comes on, this world needs more comprehensive elites to work on.	S_I0
Students in the campus will confront more challenge and competetive pressure.	S_T1
Although a majority of them insist that the capability of communication is more important than great grades, I strongly maintain that we should spend more time in study rather than social skill.	S_T0
First of all, I claim that only we have fully strengthen, other people would admire and respect you.	S_M1
Most of peple are willing to associate the outstanding people in their career and indevidual life.	B_S0
My friend, Robin, for example, went to a new company last year.	I_S0
And though she was shy, every new collegue always said hi to her and chat with her because she has exellent skills of software and numerous experience.	I_S0
Therefore, if you studied hard in university, you will be respected by other people.	E_S0
Secondly, the company will be willing to use the people who has the capacity of solving problems.	S_M1
And if one could get alone well with the collegue, but he could just do a little work in his career, he would be dismiss from the office.	S_S2
 
Nowadays, people become to pay more attation on education and begin to realize the importence of education of successfully developing our country.	S_I0
Some people consider that it is more important t invest on the education on very young children, but I suggest that the government should spend money on universities, because universities always need moor mony and can easily have a good feedback.	S_T1
Firstly, to support the education in unversities, it has to cost the government more money then invest in the youngs.	S_M1
In universities, coullege student always need professional education which needs more expensive and all-round equipment and sources.	B_S0
For example, my brother is in university who is major in automobile engineering.	I_S0
The university has to spend millions  of yuan to buy many latest cars to surpport the research of my brother's team, which  significantly cost greater money then the young children education.	E_S0
In adittion, investing in universities can much more easily to have a good achievement.	S_M1
In China, students in universities are already be chosen.	B_S0
They are much more easier to become sucessful and help the country to develop.	I_S0
On the other hand, even though the government has invest a lot of money in education of very young children, there still are some chldren do not suit for studying.	I_S0
It has low possibility to gain achievement if the government invest in the youngs.	E_S0
Lastly, a poor educational envirnment can in a degree c	O
Education of young children in a degree largrly pays attention on nurturing well-rounded individuls,	O
 
Recently,the phenomenon that parents give their children money as a reward for getting high mark in school has caused widely publc concern.	S_I0
Some people indicate that it will change the attitude of their children study,making them believe only money is the purpose of study.	B_T1
However,I contend that giving money to children is a good choice,that its merits weigh out its drawbacks.	E_T1
To begin with,giving money to the chldren as a reward can stimulate children to study harder.	S_M2
When children get reward from their	O
 
Nowadays,people are used to giving recard for something they have maken it well.	S_I0
The same to work,some parents offer their children who study in school a chance that every time they get good  grade,they can get money as recard.	B_T1
In my view of point, I totally agree with it because for this method not only can it  activate student  and let they know the meaning of recard, but also giving student to buy for relaxing.	E_T1
To start with,giving money can stimulate student to become more hard-working and be willing to get good grades.	S_M0
As many people acknowledge,it is rare for student to have their money.	B_S0
Imagin the situation,you get something that nobody who have the same  social status have.	I_S0
What will you think?	I_S0
No wondering that you are willing to get more to show that you are special.	I_S0
For money,it is the same because it is  a symble of top student.	I_S0
To keep this title or making you become more unique,you must be willing to be more hard-working.	E_S0
Secondly,you will establish a essential concept that only if you pay a lot of attention to one thing,you can get recard.	S_M0
When you get recard, you will wonder why you can get it.	B_S0
The answer is obvious.	I_S0
That is your getting have positive proporation to you hard-working.	I_S0
It is very useful in you future work field.	I_S0
I have the expeperience.	I_S0
When my mother give me ten yuan for recard of my good grade.	I_S0
I want to know why I can get it so that in the next time I can get as well.	I_S0
The answer is good grade.	I_S0
When I am aware of this, I understand the ture meaning of recard and I know that if you do nothing,it is impossible to get anything.	E_S0
Thirdly,money is a good thing for student to relax because student does not have many ways for recreation.	S_M0
if they have money,they can recharge themselves by some ways liks video games or buying something they want for a lomg time.	B_S0
And whe they finish the entertament,they are effective in the next stressful studying.	I_S0
So that money can play a role as a road of special studying system.	E_S0
That is why I think it is a good idea.	S_C2
 
Most of the people in contemporary modern lives away from the poverty and have wealthy to support their family.	S_I0
Some people think that parents can give thier children who are students money for each high grades they get in school.	S_T0
As far as I am concerned, I hold the same view.	S_T1
Adimittedly, school-age children aren't self-dicipline and they can't control themseleves to buy the thing they are favior.	S_M0
However, students should be encourages in this way to maintain their high marks and they have their own mind to decide what rewars they want with the money.	S_S2
To begin with, this kind of money is incentive to let students study harder.	S_M0
School-age students may don't know why they have to study and obtain knowledge or information they aren't insterested in; that is, they have motivation to gain high grades immerse in studying when they realize they can gain benefits from studying.	B_S0
For example, my brother used to hate sdudy and always want to buy new appealing clothes.	I_S0
My mother didn't buy clothes for him or pocket money, for he always had bad grades.	I_S0
However, after my mother agreeed with my brother that she will offer money forhim tobuy new clothes, my brother brgan to work harder.	I_S0
Addionally, my brother now really enjoys the sence of studying.	E_S0
Moreover, parents offer money when students get good grades in school can relax the students in stressful situation.	S_M0
Stufying competition become very common in recent year.	B_S0
Many students are stressed out and cant't suffer the stress and choose a bad way to kill themselves.	I_S0
Pocket money can stay the inspiration of students to study and students know that they can gain some benifits and relax.	E_S0
All in all, I agree with this statements.	S_C2
 
With the development of the Internet, the connection of community fade increasingly compared to the past time.	B_I0
In the past time, people prefer to stay with their families and people who live around them, and they are willing to help them.	I_I0
However, nowadays people, especially young people, tend to stay at home and do not bulid relationship with their neighbors anymore.	E_I0
Some people think young people nowadays do not incline to help communities, while others believe it`s not.	S_T0
From my perspective, I hold my opinion that young people do give enough time to help their communities.	S_S2
First, the way young people help coummunities has changed.	S_M1
In the past, when trains and airplanes are not available for everyone, people have a tendency to stay at their own towns, which means they have more time to stay with their own communities, and they may have more chances to help others.	B_S0
As time goes by, the connection of the world has become intense and close, so young people have less time to stay with their community, even with their families.	I_S0
Nowadays, through the voluntary activity, including taking care of young children and seniors, or cleaning the streets, young people do spend their time to help others.	I_S0
For example, during summer vacation, my friends and I would sign up for a voluntary group, and come to a elementary school to help children complete their math assignments.	I_S0
The method we connect ourselves with community has already changed.	E_S0
Second, the meaning of community has changed, which suggests that the behavior of help communities has change.	S_M1
Now with the Internet, young people could be familiar with others spread around the world, while people in the past could only reconginze few people.	B_S0
So the community has changed from a small place to the whole world, and young people are always willing to help others on the Internet.	I_S0
For instance, one of my friends is an energetic user in quora, where people put up questions and solve problems.	I_S0
By answering various questions, he has already helped others throughout the world.	E_S0
Admittedly, although it seems that young people do devote enough time to community, it`s true that young people di	O
 
It has become more common for parents to give their school-age children for each high grade they get in school, which means that the kids recieve more money when they get higher marks on the exam.	B_T1
It does not sound like a good idea becasue it brings several negative impacts during children's education devlopment.	E_T1
First off, this method may result in devlopments of bad habits for children.	S_M0
When one knows that higher marks on the exam means more money, he or she will definitely try every way to get a better mark even if the mark does not show his or her true progress.	B_S0
For example, the kid may copy others' answers or find other methods to cheat in order to achieve higher grades.	I_S0
In this case, it is certainly wrong for parents to award them becasue the money-incentive system will gradually impact their children's studying habits in negative ways.	I_S0
A lot of bad studying habits such as cheating may be self-taught by kids themselves just becasue they want the money reward too much.	E_S0
Another point worth mentioning is that money-incentive methods on students' grades can result negative impacts in building their value systems.	S_M0
When kids are taught that they can purchase things they want only if they get good grades in school, they may lose interset on other areas.	B_S0
Schools only offer a few mantory courses that children need to take, but they may gradually become weak in some other subjects such as architecture or geology.	I_S0
It also limits childrens' imagination abilities, because they are too invovled with the "must" courses they have little time to pursue their real interests in life.	E_S0
Last but not least, this method will enventually become ineffective for children.	S_M0
The reason why parents are willing to give their shool-age children money every time they achive high grades is becasue they want to see their progresses on subjects learned in school.	B_S0
However, this method will not be useful for very long time, as children are getting more and more used to this moeny-incentive system.	I_S0
Even though kids can get some extra money when they get high grades, they may become less and less interested in this system.	I_S0
The system itself can not assure a long-term effect for school-age children, which contradicts the purpose of parents' doing so.	E_S0
Based on the reasons above, offering school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is not a wise idea for their parents.	S_C2
 
Having a glimpse into this society, lots of things chane so quickly including people's thought, technology and work opportunities.	B_I0
As these changes advance into our life, I saw that a increasing number of people become more happy than people were in the past.	E_I0
Therefore, I am totally in tune that changes in world actually do not make people become less happy than people were in the past.	S_T1
In the first place, with up-to-dated technology come into our life, more and more entertainments enable people become more happy.	S_M0
The experience of me and my mother never fail to explain this opinion.	B_S0
Nowadays, computer games, television and Ps4 are highly common in people's daily life.	I_S0
This way, when I have free time, I always invite my friends come to my home; then, we played these electronic entertainments together.	I_S0
Futhermore, we always go to the movie theter together.	I_S0
All of these facilities provide people noaways fun experience.	I_S0
However, back to my mother's childhood, there is not any electronic equipment such as televition and computer.	I_S0
The only way they do in order to have fun is reading.	I_S0
In my perspective, reading all the time is really boring.	I_S0
Therefore, people nowadays who have more shapen-edging entertainment are more happy than people who were in the past.	E_S0
Secondly, nowadays people remove the barriel on traditional gap; therefore, people nowadays become more happy owing to the fact that they are more freedom living in a society which embrace everything.	S_M0
My brother,James, can use his own experience successfully illustrate this opinion.	B_S0
James fail in love with a man.	I_S0
It is known to all that failing in love with same gender is so rediculous in the past and James must endure huge social pressure and rumour if he was in the past.	I_S0
Nevertheless, with more and more publication about love between same gender and more open thought people have, it is generally accepted for this kind of love in the society.	I_S0
Therefore, James has a happy life and romantic love just like other without any negative comments.	I_S0
Therefore, with the development in soceity, people's thought become more liberate and they can embrace more thing people thought is rediculous in the past.	I_S0
Thus, people are more happy than people who were in the past.	E_S0
Finally, people have more opportunities in this world which changes so quickly.	S_M0
It is known to all that education is some luxury in the past and people always heretage their parents' vocation, which will kill lots of people's dream.	B_S0
However, nowadays, since the common education advance in this society, almost all people can obtain education.	I_S0
Furthermore, whatever your parents are, if you are exellent and have a good job in some field, you will recieve investation and get opportunities.	I_S0
Therefore, as more people can persuid their dream, people are more happy noadays.	E_S0
To sum up, I totally agree with the point that people nowadays are more happy than the past.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, people are think the education of young children is very important.	B_I0
Many class for young children are opened, parent are desire that their children can have a better achievement in their beginning of the life.	E_I0
But, we cannot ignore the education on the unversities, because the student in the university need more support than the young children, and government should spend money on them more than the young children.	S_T1
Firstly, education on the university demand more resourse than the young children.	S_M1
Education on the university is hard than the soppose of the people.	B_S0
Students on the university need a great amount of books.	I_S0
What is more, the students also need some money to buy some thing for the experience.	I_S0
It is very expensive to a university student.	I_S0
Anyhow, they cannot depend too much on their parents because their parents are old,so they need money from government.	E_S0
Secondly, the students on the university need more money because they are older.	S_M1
The students on the university have a good understand of the world, and they need money to look around the world, so that they can have a widespread recognize of the world and get more knowle    Finally, It is fact that yound children also need money because the education of childre is very important.	B_S0
However, it is not necessary result in that young children have parent, and the money they cost is not too much.	I_S0
Plus, young children cannot recerive too much knowledge so we cannot put too much money on the young children.	I_S0
If goverment spend money on the education of children, there will be no money left for the students on the university which need more money.	E_S0
As a result, I think it is more important to spend money on the education of the university.	S_C2
 
I do agree that people are willing to help those people who are in trouble.	S_T0
Admittedly, some people may concern that help struggling people might have some side effects.	S_M0
They think if they help strange people might cause some serious influence.	B_S0
For examle, once a college student helped the old man who was fall down, the old man accused it wsa he that who pulled him down, all the people claim the yong and until the truth was announced.	I_S0
If you help people who you don't familiar with, somenone might hurt you.	E_S0
But I still assert that people today are more willing to help others.	S_M0
With the advent of technology, more and more people have been educated, they have more broad thoughts, they think if everyone could help others, our society would become better and then our country will turn into a warm, strong country.	B_S1
Conversely, if we all slefish, we don't care about other's feeling and view, the relationship between everyone is harmful.	E_S1
Also, if you affraid being hurt and give up helping others, it is too pity.	S_M0
Every person has two sides, we always can meet the man who is not so good, what you do is to spare no effort to inspire his kindness side.	B_S0
Take a thing for example, a news reported a man wanted to kill a woman, because the man was too poor and he robbed the woman, the woman told him, if you want kill me, could you let me kiss my children?	I_S0
The man was so moving and it reminds him of his mother.	I_S0
At last, the man was guilty and apology for forgiving.	I_S0
Our real emotion is the key to warm others, if we give up helping others, the light in the wold might decrease.	E_S0
These two reason are why I am supporting people is willing to help others in today.	B_C1
It's not only for others, it's for yourself and the whole society.	E_C1
 
Recently, an interesting topic has aroused a heated debate among pubilc: whether to communicate in person or through emails when colleagues or classmates do a project together.	B_I0
The answers vary from person to person.	I_I0
Some people proposes that sening e-mail is a better way.	E_I0
However, I believe that talking to others face to face is a better choice.	S_T0
To begin with, communicating in person is conducive to expressing their ideas or options exactly.	S_M1
As we know, in a communication, we always understand other people not only from the sentance they say but also associating with other facial expression and body language.	B_S0
In this case, we are less likely to interprete others by mistakes, which also improve the efficiency of the conversation and the projects.	I_S0
In contrast, if we only talk to each other by email, facing the words on the computer screen, we are hard to guess the emotion of others.	I_S0
For example, last year I took participate in a competition about how to save energy with my classmates.	I_S0
At first we just send e-mail to exchange idea of this project.	I_S0
A few days later, we still did not decide what we wanted to do because of  misunderstanding other idea.	I_S0
An then we decided to have a talk face to face in a coffee house and on that day we made a consues.	I_S0
Therefore, talking in person is an efficient way to communicate.	E_S0
Furthermore, talking to each other is helpful to complish the project.	S_M1
This is because, in the science field, most of projects need to design and do experiments to illustrate a concept.	B_S0
Only when the group members gather in the lab and discusse the process of the experiment they can finish the project and attain a good result.	I_S0
gathering in the lab also guarrentte the safty of members in case of something dangerous happened.	I_S0
On the contrary, it's hard to imagnie that dong experiment by one person and talk about the process via email.	I_S0
For example, in the former project, we needed to use high velocity item in the lab to illustrate our idea.	I_S0
Our members always went to the lab to discuss from day to night.	I_S0
In this way, we could finish our project and win the competition.	E_S0
To sum up, It is advisable to communicate in person when we do project bec	O
 
What makes a job more satisfying?	B_I0
A job requires multiful tasks or only one type of similar task  on a workday ?	E_I0
I prefer to choose to do many different types of taks during the workday.	S_T1
It is boring to do similar tasks all day long, which is like the repeat of one task.	S_M0
It might be fresh to do this work on the initial few days .	B_S0
But people tend to lose interst and enthusiasm in such a repeative work in the long run.	I_S0
They will hardly find joy or fullfillment in a job.	I_S0
What may be worse is that they cannot stay in such a positon for a long time.	I_S0
Some people have claimed that they quit their job because their boss ask them to do the similar work all day long.	E_S0
On one hand, people could be more creative when they deal with a variety of tasks.	S_M0
It is a good symbol of their capability .	B_S0
They can be more active when doing many different types of tasks.	I_S0
Because when we do many different types of task, our brain works fast.	I_S0
It is believed that our brain is like a machine, it will rust if it doest work.	I_S0
And the faster our brain woks, the more creative we will be.	I_S0
Thus, we will be more happy with our achievement, which makes us more satisfied.	E_S0
On the other hand, doing different types of job is a efficient way to improve one's abilities in career.	S_M0
People are good at coping with different tasks are more likely to get a jon in the employment market.	B_S0
So people are more satisfied if they can have more chance to deal with different types of work.	I_S0
It is better for their future career development.	E_S0
Although some people may argue that practising one task could make perfect.	S_M0
So people might be happier to do one similar task all day long to sharpen their skills.	B_S0
But it is a job, not a interest.	I_S0
It is hardly to make people to be satisfied with a repeat work for a long time.	E_S0
All in all, it is more satisfying to do different types of work rather than a similar type of work all day long.	S_C2
 
Recently, there is a heated discussion regarding whether wild animals and wilderness areas need to be significant peotected by government.	B_I0
Attitides towards this issue may vary from individuals to individuals.	I_I0
There is a common conception that it is unnecessary to provide wild animals and wildness areas.	I_I0
However, from my perspective, I agree with the statement it is improtant to provide our nature areas.	E_I0
My view will be explained by analyzing the following reasons.	S_T1
One reason why I think the government should pay a highly attention to protect wild animals and wildness areas is that these can help people to sustain development.	S_M0
As we all known, there are many food chains in the nature, such as goosts eat grass and the wolves eat the goosts and so on.	B_S0
People are just one of the members of those food chains.	I_S0
Any members of the food chains lost will effect the people's development.	I_S0
As a result, people will face to be extincted.	I_S0
Take pandas for example, they are facing to be extincted nowadys.	I_S0
It is because human's population glowing fast that the habitats of pandas had been replaced by the shopping malls and streests, pandas also lost the sources of food supplements.	I_S0
If people continue to destory the wilderness areas, they will face the same problems as pandas in the future.	E_S0
Other relevant reason used to support my opinion is that protecting wild animals and wilderness areas by government enables children to receive better educations.	S_M0
Nowadys, students can just learn animals from the picures and the books.	B_S0
They will forget easilly because they can not touch the animals or get the wildness areas to see by themselves.	I_S0
Take my nephew foe example.	I_S0
When she was in elementary school, she was interesting in the wild animals but she can not learn more from the teachers because the animals was extincted.	E_S0
Admittedly, the government can put some attaintions to develop the economy.	S_M0
However, the wild animals and wilderness areas are more closer to people.	B_S0
And they are the fundemantary source to people.	I_S0
If people can not protect those, the nature will attact us, like earthquake and sandstorm.	E_S0
To sum up, it is important for gavernment to protect wild environment.	S_C2
 
Having a glimpse at today's society,people attach more and more importance to mutual helping.	B_I0
As an old saying denotes,helping others is equal to help yourself.	E_I0
Some people contends that people today are more willing to help stangers who are in trouble than the previous people,while others hold the opposite opinion,arguing that people are becoming more and more indifferent nowadays.	B_T0
As far as I am concerned,the current people are definitely no less willing to help the struggling strangers than before.	E_T0
First of all,most teenagers have received the instruction to help the surrounding people since their primary school or even kindergarten.	S_M0
Family menbers also serves as the earliest spiritual teacher,telling us to be as helpful and kind-hearted as possiple from an early age.	B_S0
All these spiritual education prepare the students to be a helpful person.	I_S0
Needless to say,the education in today's society is much more developed that that of the old times.	I_S0
Consequently,there is no denying that teenagers today possess more awareness to give their hand to people in need.	I_S0
For instance,When one of our schoolmates get ill and stay in the hospital,many of us are hoping to look after the student and help him lift a cloudy mood,even we are totally strangers.	E_S0
Furthermore,the society and media also contribute to leading people to become more willing to help strangers.	S_M0
To illustrate,some televison programs are aims at broadcasting news or events about mutual helping.	B_S0
For example,a news broadcast recently showed that a millionaire just donate a bunch of money to the village in porverty to help improve their living conditions and education facilities.	I_S0
Watching this news,all the audiences show great presage to this millinaire and many of them are destined to be inspired by him and take him as a example.	E_S0
However,exceptions should not be rashly omitted.	S_M0
There did exsists some people that are holding an offish attitude when other people meet some problems.	B_S0
According to an event broadcast a few years ago,a little girl was crashed by a car and lied in the ground for a whole afternoon,crowds of people just walked by and watched her lying in the blood,but no one stoped to help her or took her to the hospital.	I_S0
Finally,the little girl died because of the loss of blood.	I_S0
Without a doubt,the tragedy couldn't have happend if someone has been willing to help her and do her a favor.	E_S0
As a result,it is true that people today possess the awareness of helping strangers who are meeting some difficulties,nevertheless,exceptions do exsits among all current people.	B_C0
Evidently,it is too absolute to conclude that people today are more willing to help struggling strangers.	I_C0
Objective comparisons are supposed to be conducted.	I_C0
All in all,it is imperitive for the entire society to join in the effort to inspire those people who are lack of a sense of mutual helping,only in this way can they eliminate hazard metioned above.	I_C0
In this way,we can finally attain a more harmonious society.	E_C0
 
Which one can be more usefull, a well-developed Internet access or a well-developed public tranportation?	S_I0
As for me, believe that the public transportation is more important than the Internet acess because a well-developed public transportation net will benefits people in ways like bring them the convenience or improve the environment.	S_T0
Thus, I disagree with the statement in the question.	S_T1
Firstly, the public transportation will bring people a lot of convenience in their daily life.	S_M1
The public transportation will help people to go from one place to another easily because they do not need to drive their own car or help them save a lots of time on the way if the people do not have their own locomobiles.	B_S0
Like the bus  can reach many places , taxis ,cna go anywhere you want without having you to drive, subways can also reach many place and even avoid the traffic and all these conviences are what Internet cannot bring us.	I_S0
Therefore, it is more important to develop the tranportation net.	E_S0
Furthermore, the public transportation usually can help people to save a lot of money because most of them are very cheap and can save the money for you to buy locomobiles which is very expensive.	S_M1
However, the Internet always cost that mucha and a hight speed Internet usually cost more, and the money people saved can use in other places.	B_S0
For example, my uncle live in a place where has a well developed net of transportations so he can go to work by public transportation like buses and subways to where he is working even his work place is very far from where is is living,and that saved him a lots of money because he do not need to buy locomobiles like cars.	I_S0
Later on he used the money that he saved bought a big and nice house for himselves.	I_S0
One the other hand, if he lives in a place where do not have a good public transportation system but a good Internet ysytem, he might have a different result because then he needs to pay for the high speed Internet and then  he need to pay both the charge for the Internet and he needs to buys his own locomobile.	E_S0
Comparing the benefits that a good public transportation system has to the benefits a good Internet system has, I will suggest the government to improve their public transportation.	S_C2
 
Have you ever gotten awards when you get a great grade mark in the school from your parents?	B_I0
Have you ever seen some students study hard for money offerred by their parents?	I_I0
The answers are certainly.	I_I0
In order to inspire their children, many parents promise to give them money if they have a good grade in school.	E_I0
In my opinion, it is good idea for both parents and students.	S_T0
First of all, giving students money when they have a good grade in school can inspire them to study hard.	S_M1
Students don't have money source, this idea is better than give students money every week or month directly.	B_S0
Take myself for example, when I was a senior high school student, I often need some money for buying some snacks after school.	I_S0
When I talked to my mother, she promised to me that if I have gread grades in school, she would give me money, which inspired me to get a good mark.	I_S0
Through this means of insiration, I got a good grade eventually and recieved a good university offer.	E_S0
Second, students can learn how to manage their money given by their parents.	S_M1
The good thing is that students can know that money is precious, so they won't use the money without thinking.	B_S0
My brother's exprience can illustrate the point.	I_S0
My brother had used lots of money for buying the things that he didin't even need.	I_S0
But last semester, his father told him that only he get a gread grade in school will his father offer money for him.	I_S0
So in order to buy some toys he liked, he didn't watch TV in the home instead, he studying very hard.	I_S0
Certainly, he got good grades by his strive, and got money from his parents.	I_S0
After he got the money, he have never abuse the money, which gave him a good habit.	E_S0
All in all, giving students money when they get high grade is benifit for both parents and children.	B_C1
this is because it can inspire children to study hard and can learn how to manage money.	E_C1
 
Many would say that they favor to relax by doing physical exercise.	B_T0
I agree that doing some sports is a good way to it is a health way to relax.	I_T0
After all, when I am free, I always do some sports to relax because it can help me keep fit.	E_T0
However, I prefer to relaxing by a movie or a book that doing sports.	S_T1
In the first place, both watching movies or reading books are ways for people to being away from the reality.	S_M1
Since reading stories can make people concentrate on the book or movie itself, we can be away for those thing that annoyed you.	B_S0
The experience of I reading "The Bridge Of Taribithia" can prove my opinion.	I_S0
When I am reading this book, my thought always followed what the main characters experienced; I would be so sad that the girl in the book died; I would be appreciate for the friendships that people have in the story and I imagine the same scenc that the main character imagined.	I_S0
I totally forget those unhappy things happend in my life.	E_S0
In the second place, reading can not only help people relax in mental, but also help people in physics.	S_M1
There is no denying that we can read books wherever we want; therefore we can get out body relax physically.	B_S0
Sometimes people even read books before sleeping to help them sleep well.	I_S0
My roommates always do that.	I_S0
By contrast, doing sports will make people even more tired, so enven it is heathlier, it is not a g	E_S0
To sum up,whereas there is an argument about relaxing by doing physical exersices is better than watching a movie, namly keeping fit, falling into the stories, coupled with physicial relaxing, makes a strong case for the fact that it is better to relax by movies or books.	S_C2
 
Parents have differerent opinions on the strategy of teching children .	S_I0
For instance, some think that they should let children make mistakes andlet them learn from their own mistakes.	S_T1
However, others don't agreee that.	B_T0
In my opinion, I agree to the formal statement.	E_T0
As an old saying,defeat is the mother of success.	S_M1
Mistakes are not terrifing.	B_S0
In our childrenhood, we have the opportunities to make mistakes and we cost less in the mistakes compared with adults.	I_S0
It is more reasonable to make mistakes when we are children and people are more tolenrance for us.	I_S0
So don't be afraid to make mistakes ,especially for children .	I_S0
There is another reason why parents should encourage children to make mistakes.	I_S0
That is because we can learn from the mistakes.	I_S0
Only by a lot of trying can we get the correct way towards success.	I_S0
sometimes we learn more from the mistakes than success and it"s more helpful for our development.	E_S0
For instance, I have the experience of learning from mistakes.	S_M1
When I'm 8 years old,my father bought a beautiful bicycle for me.	B_S0
However, at that time I chould't play the bicycle at all.	I_S0
So I began to learn playing it.	I_S0
It was not an easy thing and I had a hard time.	I_S0
I always made mistakes but my father continully encouraged me.	I_S0
He told me making mistake was good and it was the symbol of progresee.	I_S0
Undle my father's help.	I_S0
I finally succeed in playing bicycle.	E_S0
Now when I look back, I appreciate the experience because it not only teaches me to play bicycle but also teach me that we should be brave to mistakes and we can learn a lot from it.	S_C2
 
Recently, a topic which is closely related to improvement of tourism has aroused a heated debate: should government improve the safety by increase the employment of police and improve the appearance by reconstructing the old buildings and streets to attract tourists.	S_I0
In my opinion, I definitely support that government should do these.	S_T0
To begin with, high level of safety and good appearance can bring tourists pleasant mood in traveling.	S_M1
It is obvious that people go travel for relaxation, which helps them get rid of daily stress and refresh to their jobs.	B_S0
If a place that is not safe or not in a good look, people will feel unpleased.	I_S0
They will not go there twice because the place leaves a bad impression on them.	I_S0
What is more, they will talk about their bad experience to their colleagues and friend.	I_S0
In this case, their friends will not go there neither, which will lead to the depression of the tourism development of the place.	E_S0
Moreover, safety and well appearance is benenificial to the development of a city even a country.	S_M1
Safety is of great importance for all people, which cannot be denied.	B_S0
If a city or a country does not have enough police to protect the citizens, it will lead to many serious problems such as robbering and stealing.	I_S0
Under this condition, I believe that no one wants to stay there, not to mention travel there.	I_S0
What is more, if a city or a country is in bad appearance, people will lose passion in living there, which also leads to serious problems.	I_S0
People will not go to such a bad-developed place to travel.	E_S0
From what has been mentioned above, we can draw a conclusion that	O
 
In the contemporary world, more and more people changed very independent and lonely, just like in the university, some teachers prefer to ask their students to finish their projects only themselves, but also have some teachers think that if studets can work togather, they will be learn much more effectively.	S_T1
In my opinion, I agree with the second that students much work together.	S_T0
The reasons and example will be show in the following passage.	S_S2
First, more people have more intelligences to solve problem.	S_M1
In daily life, when people are doing some works, they often have a lot of diferent problems will be found, and then people need to spend much time to deal with that, even they can not handle them and get into the trouble.	B_S0
But if have a lot of people work togather, they will have different thinking about this problem, and they all can push their idea and they can solve this problem togather.	I_S0
For example, in my last semester, my teacher let to finish a experiment about using wifi to control a little car to move.	I_S0
When I know that I was so confuse, but my classmates give me a lot of useful advise, like to find some paper of this theam, and they also help me to learn about the concept of wifi, and finaly, I finished my task ,and I get a good grade.	E_S0
Secondly, students work togathe can learn more knowledges.	S_M1
Nowadays, many students does not know how to communicate with others, and if they need to work together,  they have to face this problem, and meanwhile, the also can learn more than they they just work alone.	S_S2
Different people have different thinks, if they can  learn to e	O
 
In my personal perspective,I agree the opinion about that parens should let children make mistakes and let learn form their own mistakes.	S_T1
Firstly,It is known to us,anyone can't avoid to make mistakes,even bidness peole,and it is valuable in itself.	B_S0
secondly,there is an old saying in China,a fall into a pit is a gain.	I_S0
It means that we can learn a lot of things from mistakes.	I_S0
So we shouldn't afraid mistakes,we can think that why we make this mistake and what we can  do  to avoid it happen again.	I_S0
Thirdly,children will have more ripe mind and action befor they into socity by making mistakes.	E_S0
 
Different people learn a person in different ways.	B_I0
One's characters is closely associated with the books and the movies that the one falls in love with.	I_I0
Recently, the question about the favourite and the owner has become a major matter if concern for many people.	E_I0
Someone think from the books and movies that the person likes we can learn about this person.	S_T0
Others hold the opinion that we can not learn a peoson in this way.	S_M2
For my own part,reading the book and wacthing movies that the person likes are good ways to learn a person.	B_S0
\ Books and movies always contain a lot of elements, just like the person the story the color the sight.	I_S0
Different people show  different emotions when they face with these things.	I_S0
From these different and colorful stories and movies that the person likes we can learn about it.	I_S0
For example, my friend Tom fell in love with book THE GREAT GATSBY, he wants to be a person just like the gatsby who succeed with nothing at the beginning.	I_S0
The character from the gatsby that he is  As we all know that, there are so many books and movies in the world.	I_S0
They describe different things and show the colorful world in its own ways.	I_S0
And also, from these things we have the special list of what we fall in love with.	I_S0
Sometimes we may describe a person with words like smart handsome strict kind and so on.	I_S0
And the books and movies that the person likes are just like these words.	I_S0
We can learn a person in the same way.	E_S0
Sometimes we will fall in love with some movies and books	O
 
From my point of view,it's a good idea that parents could offer their school-aged children money for each high grade they get in school.	B_I0
The reasons are as follows.	E_I0
Firstly,offered the money for their high grade,the students will be stimulated to study harder and continually pursue higher grades,which is both of vital benefit for their academic performance and self-improvment.	S_T1
Take me for instant,if I have the capacity to "earn" extra money by myself especially gain it on account of my strength on study,I will be encouraged to be concentrated more on the school classes and try to be a all-round student,which undoubtedly will assist me a lot on my daily study and shape me to be a dedicated as well as self-arrangement student.	B_S0
What's more,by setting such kind of goal that I am supposed to seize all possible opportunities to promote myself,to enrich my study experience,to foster my abilities on academic study as well as become a master in my life,I will gain the willpower to overcome all the adversities during my study peocess,to better my capacities,and thus fulfill my personel value,which is be of essential significance for me.	I_S0
Last but not the least,by arranging the money I got from my outstanding school work,it can also provide me a chance to master the money.	I_S0
What's more,it is a kind of chance for me to learn to manage my financial resouces and motivate me to find and invest my financial resources,since I have become a college student,and it's time to face the potential difficulities during the time I turly come to the society as a specific individual.	I_S0
Meanwhile,one thing I want to emphasis is that no pay, no gain, I gain the money because I have paid much attention on my study and shouldered the obligation as a qulified student,thus it's equal for me to gain some payments.	E_S0
To sum up,as far as i am concerned,it is a practical practice for parents to offer their school-aged children money for each high grade they get in school,given all the profound and rewarding reasons all above.	S_S2
 
In my point of view,the different types of assignments being provided for employees is better than fixed similar tasks provided.	S_I0
here are the following statements I would like to use to illustrate my opinion.	S_T1
The very first reason why the variable types of tasks for workers may help workers feel more satisfied maybe the change in the work can draw the attention of the ones who are occupied with their unchangeabe mundane routine to the excitements of the new things happening around them.	S_M1
People share the same characteristic which is so called "curiosity",this is the thing that keeps us being interested in the world ,being exposed to the new items lure people to reveal the veil ,do not get bored easily, such as ,a child being surrounded by Christmas gifts,they are eager to unwrap the paper,see what is inside the box.	S_S2
A second reason is that doing the same work all day long is unhealthy to the mental and physical condition.	S_M1
Imagine o person repeatedly doing the same work including physically or just sitting in front of the computer typing the words,it is a constantly demanding job.	B_S0
For instance,a loader,whose work is loading goods on and off,continuely bending over,it is hard to say it has no damage to his body.	I_S0
As for an office worker, they may seem to be a little better,in fact they are not,they need to concentrate on the work on the computer screen ,which is really harmful to their eyesight,plus,doing the identical excel sheets,reports and powerpoints all day,it might bring them the illusion of "who am i ""where am i ""why am i doing this "kind of questions,they are more vulnerable to the psychological confusion about their job,or even carrer	E_S0
 
As the society developes at a markable speed, several aspects of the world have witness significant changes.	B_I0
When it comes to the rules that young people should obey nowadays, the topic becomes highly debatable.	I_I0
In this case , some people may hold the opinion that there are too much requirement for the youngs to follow.	E_I0
However, to give my own point, modern world provide more tolerence to the young people.	S_T0
To begin with, younger generation gains more freedom in their families.	S_M1
That alternation is probably due to the huge change social concept about the status of teenagers in families.	B_S0
In the past, it was generally accepted that the elder generations occupied  the top rank within families, which means their children were supposed to follow everything proposed by their parents.	I_S0
As a result, teenager seldom had chance to make their own dicisions.	I_S0
This phenomenon was especially typical in China.	I_S0
However, as time goes by,  the public doen't insist that the youngs and the elder should be treated differently any more.	I_S0
On the contrary, even though it is still right to show respect to the elder, the young people don't need to excecute the ditactions, which are obviously inreasonable, from their parrents.	E_S0
Moreover, young people recieve high level of freedom in terms of career choice.	S_M1
As the productivity increase dramatically, the basic demand of the country has been fullfiled.	B_S0
Consequently, young people has more right to choose the work they are really interested in instead of taking the jobs that the nation needs.	I_S0
To illustrate this point, I would like to raise a period that happened in China as an example.	I_S0
Around 50 years ago, the market-oriented  economy had not been established yet.	I_S0
As a result, teenagers that right graduated from universities would be sent to any where in the country to work since the jobs were allocated by the government.	I_S0
Instead of following their hearts, the young people were required to follow the guidance of the nation strictly without any rejection.	E_S0
Admitedly, the young still have series of principle to obey in the modern world, especially in the offices or other working situations.	S_C2
However, since the rules in the past, such as that teenager should follow in families and in career choice, have been remove, I surely agree that	O
 
Many works are in the company do their own job,  and most of works just do single kind of things during all day or even everything, everyday.	B_I0
So some of the workers dislike this tyes of work, they may prefer to have many different types of tasks to do during workday.	E_I0
In my opinion, let employee do different types of work is better, because it can motivate employee to hardworking.	S_T0
Firstly, work in a company do similar tasks all day long may make them feel boring and they may no longer work hard anymore, so if a company give thir workers many different tasks to do, the workers will more interested in their work, thus, their will work harder and in this way,  employees will work with high quality and high work efficiency.	S_M1
In addition, it will help companies gian more income becasue they have many hardworking labours.	S_S2
Secondly, put yourself in the employee's shoes, do many different types of tasks to during workday that can help improve employee's ability to work, it will inprove the working capability for employees continually, positivity and creativity of the workers, and improve the staff study ability.	S_M1
Employee can through try to doing many different tasks enrich themselves, open their eyeside and learn more new knowledge.	B_S1
All in all, workers will more satisfied	E_S1
Admittedly, some workers may more likely to be satisfied when they just need do similar tasks all day long, because in this way they donot need to study new things, they can just do the things which they aready learn how to do or they are aready do it well.	B_C1
However, do same things all day more likely feel boring, so i think do different tasks is better.	E_C1
 
Nowadays, people are getting more and more concerned about children's independence.	S_I0
If they are able to make decisions themselves or if they are independent.	B_T0
Some people say that in the past, young people are better able to make dicisions on theri own.	I_T0
However, I think today young people are better able to make dicision about their own lives.	E_T0
Firstly, young people at present have a lot of their own ideas.	S_M1
They can gain knowledge in many ways such as internet, newspapers which we don't have in the past.	B_S0
Thus, it is easier for them to develop their own thinkings.	I_S0
When I was younger, I learned a passage from the internet which said people should consist on their own characteristics.	I_S0
I believed in it and I listened form no one else.	I_S0
When my father told me to be more felxible, I said no because I learned that passage.	I_S0
So I became more and more independent and hardly take any advice form others.	I_S0
When I made dicisions, I was just fast and believe in myself.	E_S0
In addition, young people are less afraid of making mistakes now.	S_M1
They are having more and more chances for trying and doing wrong.	B_S0
Parents seem to happily provide chances for their children because their life is gettting better and there's nothing to worry about.	I_S0
But families in the past had to spend time and energy to earn a living.	I_S0
My father told me that when he was a boy, my grandmother always told him to do things for her and he should do nothing wrong.	I_S0
If my father did anything wrong even by mistake, she would punish my father.	I_S0
So, my father became more and more careful and at last, everytime when he made dicisions, he asked my grandmother for a suggestion or like, permission.	E_S0
All in all, when young people are getting more chances and braver now, they are better able to make dicision about their own lives than young people in the past.	S_C2
 
I think parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.	S_T1
Becaus children will only  remember what the mistakes they did.	B_S0
And they will never do it again.	I_S0
And actually，children will do lots of mistakes on their life.	I_S0
If parents only got mad with that,children won't know what they did and why that is a mistake.	I_S0
When i was young,i like to hit other childrens and i didn't know that is a wrong thing.	I_S0
One time,i did it again to a very tall boy,and he put my hands uder his foots,i was crying and find my mom to told her i want that boy say sorry to me,and want her help.	I_S0
But my mom said i should say sorry first because i hit that boy when he do nothing.	I_S0
So i made a mistake first.	I_S0
after the talk,i think i would never hit others again,and i knew when i make a mistake to someine,i have to say sorry for taht and never do it again.	I_S0
So,i think it's important that parents should let their children know what they did and learn from it.	E_S0
 
When speaking of the sence of satisfaction during working, some people believe that doning different types of tasks can make wrkers be more satisfied, while others support that do similar task all day long can make works happy.	S_T1
In my view, woekers will be more satisfied when they have different types of job to do during workdays.	S_T0
Firstly, having many different types of tasks can help workers to drive away the boredness of similar tasks.	S_M1
If one does similar actions all day long, he will get exhausted and tired.	B_S0
Take my fiend as an example, when he got his intern job in a big company, his supervisor gave him just one task to do.	I_S0
That is to type meeting documents into the computer.	I_S0
During his three month internship, just sat infront of the computer screen, typing all the work hours, and felt like a robot.	I_S0
In this way, he was not happy at that time and even did not want to  go to work every day.	I_S0
After that, believe people can not do just one task during work time.	I_S0
By contrasty doing various work can help to make work time more interesting and less boring.	I_S0
That is why I think workers will be more satisfied when they have different types of job to do during workdays.	E_S0
Secondly, doing diversity kinds of work can help workers to handle things more easily.	S_M1
That is to say, by coping with varying tasks, workers will be more capable at work.	B_S0
In this way, they will be stronger than they used to be and be more satisfied with what they are.	I_S0
I remember my sister who is a manager now in  a big company.	I_S0
Even though she is busy with lots of different types of works, such as joining a meeting about the recent fashion trendm giving a motive lecture to her company members, visiting the factory of her company, she tells me that she likes her job and enjoys it very much.	I_S0
For one reason, she is thankful that her different tasks make her better understand her career calue and give her chances to umprove her ability to deal difficulties.	I_S0
I will not forget how confident my sister is agter she gets promoted as the manager of her department .	I_S0
Thus I think works will be more satisfied when they have different types of job to do during work days.	I_S0
Even though doing similar tasks can make people be the expert in the working field, working on different types of tasks can offer oppportunities to explore more widely in the specific working area.	I_S0
In this way ,there will be more chance for prople to feel satisfied.	E_S0
To sum up, workers are more satisfied when they have many different ttpes of task during the workdays cause they can feel less boring and gain practical.	S_C2
 
In my view,it is better to relax by doing physical exercise than by watching a movie or reading a book.	B_S0
Beacacuse nowadays people generally have high pressure form office and classroom.	I_S0
They choose to sit on their seat for a day without a stand-up.	I_S0
As a consequence,all sorts of illnesses are caused,such as cervical illness and cold.	I_S0
Low-immunity has become a big trouble to mordern people.	I_S0
They indeed need sports to change habits and improve corporeity.	I_S0
To our comfort,doing physical exercise can not only relieve stress but also build up us,like the saying goes,"Kill two birds with one stone," What's more,obesity has become a more terrible threaten to mordern people.	I_S0
Fat perplexes us day and night.	I_S0
Plenty of Fried food make people fatter.	I_S0
Meanwhile it is acknowledged that unreasonable food,especially fried food,tends to make peolpe more nervers and upset.	I_S0
So relaxing begins from losing weight.	I_S0
By doing physical exercise,we can breathe the fresh air outdoor,experience the happiness which only the sweat can give you.	E_S0
On the other hand,relax activities such as watching movies and reading books ,more people choose to enjoy them on the bed or in the sofa.	S_M2
It also causes illness and	O
 
In nowadays' society, a friendship is  really precious.	S_I0
Because more and more people are just care about the return and aren't willing to do something for others.	S_T0
Some people thinks that it's great that making new friends.	S_T1
Thus, they prefer to have the ability which can help they easily make new friend.	S_T0
However, I prefer to maintain friendship with a small number of people over a long period time.	S_S2
Admittedly, making new friends can make you more outgoing and tolerant and also you can learn more things.	S_M0
Since you want to make many new friends, firstly, you need to make yourself confident and outgoing.	B_S0
And secondly, you should know many knowledge and be tolerant to embrace the different.	I_S0
Since your new friends maybe have the different habits, hobbies and even different culture with you, so you should know these knowledge and should also be tolerant to accept it.	I_S0
Aftering doing these, you probably will have a new friend and most important is you have learned how to be kind and polite to the people you don't know.	I_S0
In your future, you'll have to meet so many people, the ability to make many new friends easily can make you leave a good expression for most people.	I_S0
However, I still prefer to maintain just a friendship.	E_S0
Fristly, the old friends usually are the true friends, they will do the things you like and you'll feel comfortable when you are with them.	S_M0
If you are friends over a long period, your friends ceratinly will know you hobby and habits and even you'll have the same interest.	B_S0
In addition, they really konw what's you truly is, so you don't need to pretend before they, you just need to be yourself.	I_S0
For example, my friends sometimes will help me to buy the food, and they always exactly buy the food I like.	I_S0
And when you do the same project, they always can guess corerctly what I an thinking and we always have the exactly ideas.	I_S0
Thus, we can develop the programs smoothly.	E_S0
Secondly, your ture friend is the people who save you when you're in trouble.	S_M0
I don't mean that all your new friends don't want to save you, however, you're just new friend so you don't have a deep relationship.	B_S0
However, for your old friends, it's different because they are truely care abou you and you are worth to save.	I_S0
For example, my grades was not good recently, my old friends spent their free time to teach me though they're busy either.	I_S0
However, none of my new friends wnat to help me, because they don't really care about me just because they need time to go shopping.	E_S0
In the end, I think it's worth to maintain a friendships with a small number of people over a long period.	B_C1
Thus, I think the ability to maintain the friendship is more inportant.	E_C1
 
I really agree with this idea.	B_T1
I think it is a good idea that parents fooer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.	E_T1
there are some reasons about my ideas.	S_T0
Firstly,I think children need encourage for their effort.	S_M1
Though children do not need too much money during thier life,they want to buy someting like balls or tools for study.	B_S0
If they have access to choose purchase small goods, they will learn more knowledge outside the book.	I_S0
also, they will perfer to study more hardly to get high grade.	E_S0
Secondly,children need more recogntion and support from their parents, they will believe high grade means parise and love.	S_M1
And also with devoloping of the technology, there are some many learning tools on the maket.	B_S1
they could use the money to buy something they want, or but some gift to send to their friend when they attends to their friend'birthday party.	E_S1
Last but not least, I don't think parent should give too much monty that children maybe do not take advantage of these bonuses.	S_C2
The parents should ask their school-age children not to buy things that have bad influence on study,such as Game Machine, blue moives and so on.	B_S1
Also parent could know the use about the money when they give money to their children.	E_S1
 
i don`t think giving children money for a high grade is a good idea.	S_T1
First,children at school-age don`t have the ablity to arrange thier money .	S_M0
they may use thier money ona wrong way.	B_S0
An event was reported on thee newspaper sevral months ago that a primay shchool studend saved some money from his mother .	I_S0
because his mother would give him some money if he gets a grade high enough to please her.	I_S0
so every time before the test thechild work very hard inorder to get money.	I_S0
But unfoutunatly he then spend all the money he save on a computer game.	I_S0
What`s more his grade fell down to the last of the class.	E_S0
Second a child can not be simply judged by his grade at school .	S_M0
although grade big part.	B_S0
Many well known scientists and famous person did bad at school .	I_S0
such as the great scientist Newtown he was the last of his class but he did made a great discovery.	I_S0
what more we know Albert Einstein wasn`t able to speak until he was four and was kicked off the school.	E_S0
the most impoortant thing is weknow money is a great attraction tochildren if they really want to get the money  they may use some wrong way toget it such as cheating or other unproper ways.	S_M0
it is bad to the growth and the development of thier mind thoughts.	B_S0
just like the story of a prisoner.	I_S0
the man did well inhis studies and behave well until the change .	I_S0
One day his mother brought back two apples but the difference between the two is one is so much bigger thanthe other one .	I_S0
his younger brother ask immediatly for the bigger one but he then said hewoullike the smaller one and would like to givethe bigger one to his brother in a cheating way.	I_S0
Instead his mother givehim he bigger one ans sing high praise forhis behavier .	I_S0
After that he learn to cheat.	I_S0
A nd was sent in to prison for cheatting.	E_S0
i don`t think giving children money for a hingh grade is a good idea.	S_C2
 
As an old saying goes,health is the basement of everything.	S_I0
Recently,with the development of the technology,people have less and less time to exercise themselves.	S_T1
Take one of my friends as an example,every time we are off class,he will call on a lot of my classmates to the net bar,trying to play games to relax themselves.	B_S1
But as a bad result,he doesn't really relax and his eyes has been badly damaged due to playing games too long.	E_S1
Of course,everyone don't want to see the bad result that happened to my friend.	S_M0
But most people are just like my friend,using the modern technology to relax themselves,such as watching films,playing games...	B_S1
So,do we need that just drop our computers and cellpones a while,trying to do exercise to relax ourselves?	E_S1
As for doing exercise,there many good choices.	S_M0
We can just run around the playground or our building,we can try to walk or ride a bike to school and work instead of drving or taking taxi.	B_S0
For boys,basketballdand football are perfect sports to relax and exerice.	I_S0
For girls,doing yoga is also an excellent idea.	I_S0
As you see,there many ways to do exercise,no matter where you are,which is more colorful and covenient than just reading a book or going to movies.	I_S0
Also,doing exercise can not only help you to relax but also keep your body healthy.	E_S0
If you haven't tried to exercise yourself,never mind.	S_M0
It's never too late to learn to this new pattern to relax.	B_S0
If you are tired of traditional items, never mind.	I_S0
there will be a great choice for you.	I_S0
If you say you don't have  much time,never mind.	I_S0
Exercise is just a thing that can be done in any place and any time.	E_S0
So,what you are waiting for?	B_C1
Trying to exercise more in your spare time,you will get more fun than just watching a movie!	E_C1
 
Every children are differents.	B_I0
They have different levels in every subject.	E_I0
If the good score is bought with money rather than his true skill, it is insignificant.	B_T0
So I think this is a bad idea to offer children money for high mask .	E_T0
The condition is disadvantage for children development.	S_M1
I think the parents baviour can make children become lazy.	S_S2
It make children unable to recognize the true self.	S_M1
School-age children have not enough skill to discern between good and bad.	S_S2
The parents measure would make children have more dependent on parents.	B_C1
When children grow up, they will always be separated from their parents.	E_C1
Before they go into social, school is a well palace which can teach them how to become a better people.	B_S0
If children in school become successful is due to their their parents, they will lose their ability about dependment.	I_S0
And they will forget to effort to get what thet want.	E_S0
When they meet difficulties in social, they ea	O
 
Nowadys,people have more mony then their parents' periold.	B_I0
They offten buy some expensive toys or anyother things for their children.	E_I0
Some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school, I think maybe it's not a bad thing for their children to growth.	S_T1
Because it will teach the children to management  money by themselves when they was young.	S_S2
And children can buy some food when they are hungry in the school.	S_T1
Firstly,it's important to management money	S_S2
 
When asked about the question that how do you think offer  school-age children money for each high grade they get in school ,people usually exhibit an air of uncertainty.	S_I0
Some people claim that it is a good idea , while others, advocate it is a bad advice.	B_T0
From my perspective, it is a good idea.	E_T0
First, it can inspirted children to work harder, since they can get money from the high grade and use these money to buy what they want, they will try their best to study and be eager to learn new knowleage.	S_M0
When I was that age, may mother will give me 10 dollars if I got a full grade in a subject,I found the chemistry is very easy to get a full grades so  I try  my best to study chemistry, and at last I not only got a full grades and money, I also win a first prize of a chemical competition which help me to get an offer from a university.	S_S2
Second it can help children to learn about the money things.	S_M0
If the children get money from high grades they will find that harworking is worthy and it will get them a lot which can encourage to work harder even they are not in school.	B_S0
And since they have a lot of money , they will thought about how to use it, one of my friends are like that, first of all he use his harde money to buy a lot of comic books but then he find it was easily to cost his money and at last he always poor.	I_S0
Because the money is coming from his har working, he begun to learn mangement about his money and use his money to do some reaserch .	I_S0
At last he got 10 times of his money and use these money to buy a car.	E_S0
Even though some may say that it will make the children to study for money not for their inteerest , interst things are not born with children.	S_M0
They must leran further until they know what they are interested.	B_S0
If they got high grades in one subject, they may pay attention to the subject and learn more about the subject in order to get a high grades, and with his study ,he may find it is interesting and then find what he want to do hole life.	I_S0
For instance, at first I am not interested in chemistry, but when I get a high grades once time ,in order to earn money I begun to lern further about the chemistry ,I study the orgnic chemistry which was not taught in high school by myself ,and I got interest in it and now my major is about nutural chemistry and I thout it will be my hole life works.	E_S0
In conclusion, offer shcool-age childrenmoney for each high grade they get in school has a lots of benefits and it is desire to be used on the school-age children.	S_C2
 
Nowadays,  students are suffering big pressure from the countless tests.	S_I0
They will be pounished by their parents if they get bad scores, they will be given rewards if they get good scores.	S_T0
However, some parents are extremly thinking that giving money to their children as an reward is the best way to encourage them.	S_T1
But I don't agree this idea foe several reasons.	S_T0
First of all, the children are just at school-age and they have no cognitive ability to the money.	S_M0
Dispute they only know that they can use money to buy staffs which they want to buy.	B_S0
Moreover, they will slowly recogenize that they can use money to buy anything in their lives, such as snacks, toys and so on.	I_S0
And if their parents never stop to give them money if they obtain good scores, they will realize they can get money if they get higher scores.	I_S0
Constantly, they become more likely depend on money, and all they want are just high scores.	E_S0
Meanwhile, if they know that using high grade can exchange in money , they will cheat to their parents by using fake grades.	S_M0
What's more, this behaviour will probably leads to crime when these children are getting older because of the cheating.	S_S2
In another perspective, if parents just give kid rewards as gift and do not exactly know what the real capacity their kids have, this will lead to decreasing of their family communication bound.	S_M0
The parents will know their kids less and less and it turns to a raw relationship between the children and the parents.	S_S2
All in all, I totally don't agree this kind of behaviour.	B_C0
Whether the parents are unconsciouly know what will happen in the future or not, it is harmful to the children who are at school-age.	I_C0
The parents ignore the potential risk of this action, however, they can use other  ways to encourage and award their kids who they love the most.	E_C0
 
Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate amon people: In order to succeed, whether it is better to be like others rather than different from everybody else?	B_I0
Some claim that being like others can help people make more friends and friends can help people succeed.	E_I0
However, contrary to their view comes to my perspective that it is better to be different from every body else in order to succeed.	S_T0
To begin with, being different from everybody else gives people more opportunities.	S_M1
To be more specific, people always notice those who are different from others.	B_S0
If some one is different from others, it means that he will give others an impressive first imprssion.	I_S0
When people have some good idea or opportunity, they will first remember the one who is different from others.	I_S0
On the contrary, if you just act like others, then nobody will remember you since you are normal and nothing special.	I_S0
For example, my uncle Wang always work late and he was the last one left the office.	I_S0
He did not like others who just stay away from office after 5 p.m. Becase he was so different, his boss noticed him and gave him a lot of chance to accumulate experience.	I_S0
And sooner, my uncle became the charge of his department.	E_S0
To be followed, being different from everybody else makes people more creative.	S_M1
To illustrate, is is not so easy to be different from everbody else.	B_S0
People have to learn a lot or create something new to show the difference.	I_S0
In this case, those who are different from everbody else must be creative and creative people are more likely to succeed.	I_S0
On the contrary, those who just act like others obviously cannot create something since they never think about different.	I_S0
For example, Jobs, the founder of  Apple, the richest and most creative man since he change the whole industry of mobile phone.	I_S0
He was so different from others because he was crazy about perfect and beauty.	I_S0
He forced the Apple to made to most perfect phone of the world.	I_S0
It is undoubtedly that he was successful because of his difference.	E_S0
In conclusion, being different not only gives people more opportunities but also makes them more creative and these factors are also the important factors to succeed.	S_C2
 
Recently, an intersting topic has aroused a heated debate among the public:whether people will cost less time cooking and preparing foods in twenty years than they do today.	B_S0
The answers vary from person to person.	I_S0
Some people think that mroden people are spend less time on cooking and preparing foods, while I believe that people take less time to cook in twenty years than we do today.	I_S0
My reasons will be elaberated as follows.	E_S0
First, they will have more advance technology equipments to use when they are cooking.	S_M2
That is because that the develop of techenology is increasing quickly, so maybe in twenty years, they will have more use for techenol	O
 
Nowadays, the form of students' homework has changed.	B_I0
And whenever asked whether when teacher assign projects for students to work together, they will learn more effectively than they work by themselves, people usually exhibit an air of uncertainty.	E_I0
However, I disagree because there are several factors that will affect students' effeciency when they work together.	S_T0
To begin with, different opinions may cause arguments, which may waste much time.	S_M0
Every student is different so when students work together, they may have totally different ideas, which can lead to arguments in the group.	B_S0
Thus, students may have to spend a lot of time try to talk to each other, and try to find a solution to the conflict.	I_S0
And this will absolutely waste a lot of time doing nothing about the project.	I_S0
In other words, students may work less effectively when they work together.	E_S0
Then, when students do a project together, they may end up playing together.	S_M0
Many students are not adults yet, so they may not control themselves.	B_S0
Moreover, it is students' nature to play with others.	I_S0
Thus, when students have a project for them to work in a group, they may gather together, but gradually forget what they should do and end up playing togerther instead of working on their project.	I_S0
Take my own experiencce as an example, when I was in primary school, I have a text-based drama to practice with some of my classmates, so we went to one of the students' home.	I_S0
After several hours, we did almost nothing.	I_S0
Instead, we were playing PS4 together.	I_S0
So I don't think students can work more effectively wen they work together.	E_S0
Last but not the least, I admit that students may have different roles when they work in a group, which means they can work faster than working alone.	S_M0
However, it also has a chance to cause chaos.	B_S0
For example, when there are too many people in a group, it may be too noisy that few people can hear what others have said.	I_S0
Then, they will try to yell, which will make the room more noisy.	I_S0
Moreover, in this kind of situation, students are easier to make mistakes or can not continue their work.	I_S0
So maybe working together may have some vantages, but the shortages can not be ignored.	E_S0
To conclude, although there are vantages, but I think the shortages of students working together outweights the vantages.	B_C1
So they may not work more effectively when they work together.	E_C1
 
Nowadays, everyone give high exectations to themselves and struggles for their life everyday, since only hardwork can takes people success.	S_I0
However, with the development of society, there is less and less chances for individuals to succeed, since the competition in the market is becoming more fierce.	S_T0
So In my own view, If someone wants to attain success, he must behave differently, which them more knowledgeable, experienced than others.	S_S2
Firstly, only can you work harder for knowledge can you gain success.	S_M1
There are too many people dreaming for success, so you are supposed to be more knowledgeble.	B_S0
In this way, you can have the capacity to do your work better than others,  such as in your major or in your position in the company.	I_S0
Accumulating knowlegdge is the ladder to success, whjch means that you should learn to get the hang of important knowledge and make progress everyday.	I_S0
But if you are not knowledgeable enough, no one will regard you as a potantial successful person, since you can not do many things well and you are just the same as other normal people.	E_S0
Secondly, I think you are expected to bebetteretting along with others.	S_M1
Friendship is very significant because friends can help you get out of the trouble and give you help when you need, which is neccessary to your success.	B_S0
Besides, when you are disappointed or too stressful due to the great pressure from life, friends are able to impel you calm down and get pleasured by communicating or playing some interesting games together.	I_S0
If you are poor at dealing with others, It is easy for you to lose the enthusiasm towards life, because there is no one you can turn for help or comfort.	I_S0
Without enthusiasm, success will be out of reach.	E_S0
So, in a word, if you want to succeed, you are supposed to behave differenty, so you can be distinguished from one's kind.	S_C2
 
It is undeniable that younger people nowadays are more likely to be affected by celebrities than before, because they are more exposed to the information about them and opinions of celebrities seem to be made up to attract more people.	B_I0
As to older people, most of them have already formed their ideas about things and are not as interested as younger people in celebrities.	E_I0
In that regard, I agree with the statement that opinions of celebrities are more important to younger than older people.	S_T0
First of all, younger and older people are exposed to different level of pubic opinions, and the former always get more.	S_M1
To illustrate, take a grandson and a grandfather in a family.	B_S0
The younger, the grandson, have various access to leading opinions, such as by sufing the Internet, reading a magzine or chatting with friends.	I_S0
However, the grandfather, likewise the older, might only know a celebrity on TV news or morning newspaper.	I_S0
In other words, older people just need some news around, while younger require the opinions of celebrities.	I_S0
Even though the two people are in one family, they could have different exposure of opinions of celebrities.	I_S0
What I want to emphasize is that the younger one in the family have obviously more ways to know about famous people than the older one do, which means a higher level of influence.	E_S0
Secondly, because of the eleboration of celebrities' opinions, younger people, who are closer to those ideas, tend to be convinced by them while older people insist their own ideas about life and things.	S_M1
It is natural for the celebrities to maintain certain images in front of their audience, for instance, a famous actor needs to be though as a gentle man to attract more female fans, or an athlete want to act like more powerful and opimistic than he truly is because in that way he may get more advertising chances.	B_S0
Thus the opinions of these celebrities must be intentionaly processed.	I_S0
Moreover, the belief in celebrities' opinions of younger people also calls for more positive information from the celebrities.	I_S0
Both the two sides indicates the importance of famous celebrities  to younger people.	E_S0
For the reasons for more exposure and eleboration, I agree that opinions of celebrities are more important to younger than older, and thus those opinions are necessary to be positively leading.	S_C2
 
I disgree the idea "it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.	B_I0
Firstly,you will never known how fun it is to finish a physical exercise.	I_I0
You may feel that your body is full of energe and you are so excited that you seems to start a new life.	I_I0
However,after watching a movie or reading a book,maybe you are happy for a little time,but you will feel really tired soon or later.	I_I0
Never think that watching or reading can relax fou your brain.	E_I0
Only physical exercise could.	S_T1
Secondly,physical exercise is good for health.	S_M2
Rooted in my mind was a time when I was so fat that I felt frustrated all days.	B_S0
No matter how hard I tried,I still could not get good grades and made good friends.	I_S0
Then I abandon myself to books and TV shows,but it did not work.	I_S0
Thanks to my parents,they encouraged me to do exercises for rest.	I_S0
And I accepted,this way is really effective,I became slender and I gained great fun at the same time.	E_S0
Last but not the least,taking physical exercises is the key to bacoming happy,I really hope that everyone can enjoy it.	B_C1
So comr on,let us do exercise.	E_C1
 
Now, some students and scholars believe that the university needs to give the high salaries to the professors, in order to enhance the quality of the education.	S_I0
But some people disagree with this opinion, they think this way can't improve the teaching quality for the university education.	B_T0
From my pespective, I agree with the statement.	E_T0
I have several reasons to explain why.	S_T1
Firstly,best people always want to go to the working places where have high salaries, so the best professors also want to go to the university which has high salaries.	S_M0
For example, there are two universities in a city.	B_S0
One of them has 100,000 dollars per year, but another has 150,000 dollars per year.	I_S0
So a lot of best professors want to go to the latter one, and the quality of the education has significant increasing.	I_S0
During several years, more than 10 students won the Noble prize.	I_S0
So this university has a excellent reputation on the society, and more and more students want to apply it.	E_S0
Secondly, a high salaries can cheer the professors up, they will be more hard-working.	S_M0
Harvard, Yale, the very excellent universities in the world, also pays a high salaries to the professor.	B_S0
The professors always put all of their energy in working, they always working more than 16 hours in a day, and they cultivate a lot of excellent students.	I_S0
If the students are excellent, the quality are also be improved.	E_S0
Finally, if the university uses more money on other things, are also unrelated to the education qualities.	S_M0
If a university put a lot of money in the teaching facilities, it will looks more nice.	B_S0
In a short-term, more and more students will be attracted to apply the university.	I_S0
But the students and teachers are just focus on the best facilities, not on working and studying, the quality of teaching will not be enhanced, even declined.	I_S0
A university puts 1,000,000 dollars on renew the facilities, students just like the facilities, not on learning.	I_S0
So the fame for the university are not changed yet.	I_S0
So the important things is chaning the professors.	I_S0
The professors are the important leader for university students.	E_S0
So, on the aspects of the professors living, their working attitude, and the importance for the university students.	B_C1
I think the university needs to pay high salaries to the professors.	E_C1
 
These days, education of family have played a more and more important role in children's value view.	B_T1
Some parents believe that children should learn from their own mistakes and it may help them remember it .	I_T1
While others believe that it may beat the confidence of children.	I_T1
Even though it is ture that it may be bad for the building of students' confident,there is no doubt that the children could avoid it next time.	E_T1
Thus, I believe that parents should let children make mistakes and learn from them.	S_S2
it is obviously that mistakes and troubles could be better for children to build the sense of dangerous and try to avoid it next time .	S_M2
It is unavoidable for children to make mistakes , even adults often make mistakes during the process of work and life.	B_S0
However , whether they could learn from mistakes is the most important part of that.	I_S0
Children , a group of people who could learn thing at the fastest speed , could accept these education and adopt it quickly.	I_S0
Taking me as a good example, when I was young children , my mother gave me 100 yuan to buy stuffs.	I_S0
I was lied by adults due to my careless, I bought a cheap good at a high price.	I_S0
I am very regardless about it and my mother blamed in me and hope that I could learn from this mistake.	I_S0
if I was not lied at that time,I would not be careful about money when I grow up.	E_S0
In this circumstance, Children is in a best stage which could learn lots of things from the society.	B_C0
It is commonly accepted that today's sociey has developed at a remarkable speed,there are more and more new technologies in our daily life .	I_C0
Children have no self - consciousness about them.	I_C0
Hence, mistakes is a good teachers to make children know the harmful  of these technologies .	I_C0
It may help them to remember mistakes harder All in all , it is a good way for children to learn from mistakes.	E_C0
 
Award is a good way to stimulate a person to do better.	S_T0
So in our society now, there occurs a kind of condition about that parents will award some pucky money to the students which have great beheavior or get high marks in campus.	B_T1
I think it is a good idea and option to improve the enthusiasm of studying despite there are some small problems.	E_T1
Gaving money to award students can give a hand to students to build a positive learning attitude.	S_M0
It is easy to see that a award can give a push on students in studying because money is really attracting the students.	B_S0
In this case students will cost more time to focus on lesson and assignment.	I_S0
For example, student which can get a great sum of money if he get a good grade at school, will have more impetus and power to study.	I_S0
He may do more exercises than other students.	E_S0
Gaving money to award students can also make students released during the learning process.	S_M0
It will let student to get a clear goal, so that students will be less stressful and can only work hard in one direction.	B_S0
This way means awarding money can reduce the other distracting thoughts like self doubt.	I_S0
For example, students noew is easy to doubt themselves.	I_S0
They may usually ask themseves why they need to study or whom they study for.	I_S0
This is a action which really kill time, but money can wash away these negative ideas out of your mind and provide a clean environment in your heart to focus on studying.	E_S0
Although this way has lots of benefit, it also has some bad effect.	S_M0
students may get some bad influence if they have lots of money and cost a lot.	B_S0
A higer expenditure fee iss ntot good for the children in their school age.	I_S0
they may not have enough kowledge or expiriences to know how to spend money and how to save money.	I_S0
they may cost much on luxury stuff and they may even smoke or take drug.	I_S0
by the way, it may also let them develope a idea sbout making money is easy.	I_S0
so parent must contol the sum of money which to be the award.	I_S0
if parents do so, this problem will be solved.	E_S0
In conclusion, gaving money to award students has many benefit, but people need to use it in a proper way, and it will make a de	S_C2
 
Liang Qichao, the famous Chinese writer has said "if young people are successful, their country will successful, too " which shows the importanec of young people for a country.	S_T1
Nowadays many people believe that young people have no influence on the decisions which is important for our society.	B_T0
I do not agree with them.	E_T0
At first, young people can show thier ideas and suggestions to the grovernment durectly.	S_M1
Nowadays government is more and more willing to listen to the public's vioce include what young people think.	B_S0
They will follow a good suggestion no matter who make it up.	I_S0
For example, the city I lived in was going to build subway in 2008.	I_S0
And the government asked for advice about where should the stations localed.	I_S0
The students in Wuhan university made a map to show where most of the people lived in and suggest stations should localed around these place.	I_S0
The government accept their suggestions and even post thier thank to the students in the newpapers.	I_S0
So it is much easier for young to show their opinions to government than the past.	I_S0
Young can make huge influence on the important decosions if their ideas are good enough.	E_S0
And young people can make influence in the important decisions by changing older people's minds.	S_M1
It is quite common for parents to chat with their children.	B_S0
Sometimes, if the children's ideas is reasonable enough, their parents or teachers will agree with them.	I_S0
For example, we all know the vote in American.	I_S0
The people over 18 years old had the right to vote for the people they liked.	I_S0
But that did not means that people younger than 18 had no influence on that.	I_S0
I once read a  price of news that a ten years old boys make the whole community vote for Trump.	I_S0
He just went around and told his own ideas to the adults.	I_S0
And many people thought his ideas was very correct and turned to vote for Trump.	I_S0
So if young can not make influence in the important decisions directly, they can make people who surunding them to agree their ideas.	I_S0
And these can make huge influence, too.	E_S0
So is  not ture that young people have no influence on the decisions which is important for our society.	S_C2
 
As far as I am consered,those parents who give their children money for each high grade (mark) are pretty wise.	S_T1
Because it can teach the children the sense of the impressment.	S_T0
In may opinion,the school-age children's ponsibilitis are reading books hard and get good grades.	S_M2
If they can't finish there school work,why can they get their money.	B_S0
It is not easy for parents to earn money,so the children is impacted to work hard in their school life.	I_S0
The money is not lead the children to think that the money is the most importtant thing in life.	I_S0
It just teaches them that no pain,no gain.	I_S0
We are all in a world which is filled with presure.	I_S0
How can we struggle in this world----fighting and fighting.	I_S0
With the development of the society,we must improve us every minute.	I_S0
If we are slower then anyone around us,it is possible that we will fail in the next competation.	I_S0
So do the school-age children,the parents offer them money for each high grade(mark)  they get in school is to help them have the sense of impressment.	I_S0
If a child have the good education of the competation,he will adjust the society quicklier than other children.	E_S0
All in all,I can't agree  more with these parents.	B_C0
I believe that the children who are teached by them can grow quicklier in the future.	I_C0
Because they know more about the meaning of "no pain,no gain".	E_C0
 
In such an dog-eat-dog society, everyone is struggling for its own happiness, but there are some ideas suggest that people should not be so aggressive to achieve success.	S_T0
So a heated debate has been aroused that whether sucess is significant or it is more significant to stay happy and optimistic when you fail.	S_T1
From my perspective, I hold the view that it is more essential for everyone to keep happy and optimistic.	S_T0
Here are some examples and reasons supported my viewpoint.	S_T1
First, it is universally acknowledged that stay an optimistic life can increase our chance to succeed.	S_M1
Since people have an positive attitude towards life and there failure, people can judge themselves rightly and notice the shortcoming or mistakes they made in their failure.	B_S0
Therefore, when people try next time, they are more likely to achieve success.	I_S0
In contrast, if people focus on the result and hold a pessimistic attitude towards failure, they might witness their mistakes and magnify the mistakes.	I_S0
So they might under great pressure when they try next time, resulting another failure.	I_S0
For example, when I was an high school student, I often remain happy towards study and optimistic towards my failure in exams.	I_S0
Even when I cannot pass the math exam with a grade 40, I told myself that others cannot get a good grade as well and I am not good at math.	I_S0
So next time, I do not have so much pressure and do what I can do in the math exam and finally get an average grade 60.	E_S0
Second, remaining optimistic can help build lots of relationship and thus easier to success.	S_M1
Since people have optimistic attitude when communicating with others, they are more likely to share funny things to others.	B_S0
Therefore, they might make a large number of friends because people love to make humorous friends.	I_S0
lots of friend can be a key to success for the reason that more friends represent more helpers.	I_S0
On the contrary, those people who cannot stay a happy attitude might have little friends because they are not confident in themselves.	I_S0
For instance, I have a friend in high school who is a really humorous people.	I_S0
Whatever bad things he met he would descride it as an interesting adventure.	I_S0
Everyone love to be his friends and he benefit a lot from his friends like sharing notes and bringing breakfasts.	E_S0
To put it into a nutsell, I firmly believe that people should stay happy and optimistic when you fail.	S_C2
 
For me, I don't think offer children money for high grade is a good idea.	B_T0
Firstly, we study knowledge because we need get more useful thing, like the specific think to everything we meet.	E_T0
but if we give children money for thier high grade, they may think that they study for money,study good will get more money.	S_T1
Time goes on, when they go to university, they may don't have interest in study, because study good is only means more money, but it not true.	S_T0
secondly, children often don't know how to use money, thier parents give them money maybe expect they can use money in studyng,buy pen or notebook.	S_M0
however, children may use money to buy snakes or joys, it will influences thier study.	S_S2
thirdly, if we want to encourage our children to study, we can use other ways to do it.	S_M0
For example, when children have good grade, we can give them some gifts like book or pen, but not money.	B_S1
We can take them go camping, see some sights, play games with them or other ways.	E_S1
I know parents expect their children have a good grade for a good future, and parents often have their work, so they don't have enough time to help children in study .	S_M0
Parents give children money as a way to encourage children to study.	B_S1
But I think children's study is more importent than work, and money can't do everything, parents should spend more time with thier children, concentrate on children's study and grow.	E_S1
finally, in one hand,if we want, we can have many ways to encourage children to study,needn't give them money.	B_C0
On the other hand, give them money may take many bad effects, like bad habbits to use money.	I_C0
So, I don't think offer school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a good idea.	E_C0
 
In my college, some teachers may make mistakes when they are teaching.	S_I0
In this condition, some students may interrupt teacher right away and correct the teacher's mistakes, some students choose to tell the teacher after class, and the rest of the students will say nothing.	S_T1
As far as I am concerned, I will tell the teacher right away when they make mistakes.	S_T0
Here are my reasons.	S_T1
First of all, teliing teachers the mistakes immediately can aviod us forget the mistakes.	S_M1
If we wait until the class is over, maybe we have forgetten the wrong knowldge that teachers said.	B_S0
Take my experiment for example, last week when my  math teacher was writing the points on the blackboard, I suddenly found that he write a wrong fomula about the light speed.	I_S0
But I don't want to interrupt the class, so I decided to wait until the class is over and tell the teather privatly.	I_S0
But when the class overed, I had already forgotten this mistake and until next day I had remenbered it, which is too late to correct it.	I_S0
Had I correct the mistake immediately, I had not forgotten the mistake that I need to correct.	E_S0
Second, only interrupt the teacher and correct the mistake in the class can every students know the right knowledge.	S_M1
If we wait until the class is over, other students may already leave, so they may learn the incorrect knowledge.	B_S0
My brother's story can illustrates the point.	I_S0
He attended a class that the school had just opened.	E_S0
 
At the modon socierty, high degree is become more and more importen.	B_I0
Whether can we find a good job, whether can we earn enough money to  suppose our family daily live, even through whether can we find a nice girlfriend or boy friend, all this question which inportant for us is connect our  drgee.	E_I0
But as a child, they may not clearly feel about that, and they also don't have enough attention to control themselves.	B_T1
In their word, playing just the importent thing.	I_T1
So their parents, as a person know how importent the degree is, will try a number of way to let their student to study, in order to get a high degree for their child could have a brighting future.	E_T1
One of the way is to offer their children money when they get high grade in school.	S_M2
Use this money, children can buy the thing that they really want, so they may work hard to sutdy, in order to get high grade.	B_S0
But I don't think this is a smart way.	I_S0
First the thing children use the money which they got for their hight great in school to buy may not good for their study.	I_S0
Second chindren use high grade to eran the money, they may use some  another way to get the high grade like chess not work hard in their study.	I_S0
Last,And they may feel just I want money when I study hard ,if I don't want I can not study.	E_S0
In my openion, parent should use some oeher thing to attract student to study, to make them intrested in study, no use the way like this.	S_C2
 
My friend Jin complained a lot to me couple months ago, he told me his grandparents blamed on him becasue he never help with the community.	B_I0
However he did not think he did anything wrong.	I_I0
So do young people nawadays don't give enough time to helping their communities?	I_I0
Some would say yes becasue they are too busy to help with communities, others may think young people have taken enought time to help with communities by volunteering.	E_I0
From my point of view, I strongly agree with the statement for some reasons such as they have heavy academic tasts and they need to develop their hobbies.	S_T0
To begin with, young people do not spend enough time for helping their communities becasue they have heavy academic tasts.	S_M1
In China, young people like students spend over ten hours in school at least five times a week.	B_S0
Furthermore, there are a lot of homework need to be done by the second day.	I_S0
So young people hardly have time to help with their communities.	I_S0
For instance, my friend Jin was one of the victims.	I_S0
He studied in Wuhan No1 high school, which is the best school in our city.	I_S0
He stayed at school six days a week and his situation was even worse becasue he couldn't go outside school.	I_S0
In addition, he also had a lot of homework to do.	I_S0
The most important thing was he wanted to help with communities but he didn't have time.	I_S0
So that's one of the reason that why young people nowadays do not give enough time helping with their communities.	E_S0
Furthermore, developing own hobbies could also be the crucial reason that why they don't give enough time to helping with communities.	S_M1
As I said, students spend five or six days a week studying in the school.	B_S0
They really need to enjoy their weekends, isn't it?	I_S0
There is nothing wrong if they want to play video games, travel with friends, play a sport or anything else.	I_S0
Here is an example of my friend Mike.	I_S0
Mike also live in school for six days a week.	I_S0
He studied very hard during weekdays.	I_S0
Also he liked to play basketball.	I_S0
He spent more than four hours to play basketball on Sunday.	I_S0
I had to say his parents supported him to play basketball because they thought everybody should have at least one hobby.	I_S0
The thing I can not imagine is Mike is the captain of the basketball team in his university now.	I_S0
This is also the reason that why young people nowadays are lack of time helping their communities.	E_S0
Although some of young people take time to help with the communities by volunteer, I still think they don't have that much time to help with their communities becasue they have heavy academic tasks to do and also their personal hobbies should be developed as well.	S_C2
 
With the improvement of people's living condition, many distinct eating ways have been appeared.	B_I0
So a controversial topic arouses a debate: whether people will spend less time cooking or preparing food in twenty years than today.	I_I0
Varied people have different idea.	I_I0
Some people think cooking can help them escape from heavy load of working.	I_I0
But I hold the view that in the future, people ought to spend less time on preparing food.	E_I0
The reasons can be illustrated as follows.	S_T0
First, nowadays we have not enough time to cook so that we have many methods to get food to eat.	S_M1
People often buy food in the Family Mart or Today that provide the food similiar to housemade because should work about 8 hours a day and 3 hours will be spent on the conmuting.	B_S0
As the time goes by, our time should be use on the most profitable work but not cooking.	I_S0
For example, My mother has been worked in a company, she always went to work at 7 a.m and back to home at 6 p.m. Later, she got promotion and should work for more time.	I_S0
Thus, she have not time to cook so she will buy the food from the mart.	E_S0
Second, there is no need to cook food by ourselves because we can easily get food from the online and offline sevice.	S_M1
People can easily buy the food they like through the service.	B_S0
People only should pay the delivery bills more that they can get the food in half hours without preparing and cleaning the kitchen.	I_S0
Imagining a person, he wants to eat the beef.	I_S0
If he cook it himself, he should clean all the kitchen for an hour after ten-minute eating.	I_S0
If he just make an order through the App, he can enjoy the food without any other action.	E_S0
So in the future, the	O
 
Since having a good job seems to be such an important part of our life, the question of whether it is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to ther parents' jobs than to choose different jobs are something that we discussed over and over again through our whole life.	B_T0
Even though this is something that I do not really think that worth our effort to argue about, since everybody has their own characteristics and interests, it is not up to us to decide what it good for them.	I_T0
Personally speaking, I do think it is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs.	I_T0
There are just so much beneficials if they choose to do the same jobs, and the reasons are as follows.	E_T0
Firstly, most children growing up with their parents will inevitablly influced by their parents' career.	S_M1
What their parents been talking during the dinner time, what they have been reading will all have an impact on thh children.	B_S0
The children will have a sense of idea of what their parents are doing, and it is likely for the children to grow an interest on the similar subjects since the children are hearing or looking at it all day.	I_S0
Studying all those "second- hand" related information while growing up is a marvelous preperation for the children before they enter the college to study those subjects.	I_S0
Taking myself as an example, my father is an archaeologist focusing on the ancient Asian Art.	I_S0
He can talk about the ancient bronzes all day nonestop, and my family have a giant collection of archaeological books.	I_S0
I grew up reading those books talking about ancient pieces of art, and I developed a deep interest in Art History.	I_S0
Eventually I choose to study Art History as my major during my college, and with the information my dad had taught me before hand, I do feel myself is better prepared for college academic life.	I_S0
So choosing a job that is similar to parents' job can help children to develop an early interest and prepare themselves for the higher-level study,	E_S0
What I have been discussed about earlier is before the children entering the "Adult World" of finding jobs, and the second reason why it is beneficial for children to choose a job that similar to their parents' is that the parents can provide the children more resources and suggestions.	S_M1
I think most parents want to provide their children the best thing they have, and  things that are really important during work are resources and experiences.	B_S0
Choosing a similar job means, the children is entering a world that is very familar to the parents, they parents can provide so many priceless suggestions about how to do well in certain place since the parents themselves have so many experience already.	I_S0
Since the parents have already worked for so long, they also have their own social networking that was build while working.	I_S0
As we all know, social networing is essential when we are working, and have a strong and free networing that is provided by the parents are just marvelous.	I_S0
If the children choose a job that is totally different from their parents, those are the benefits that they cannot really enjoy.	E_S0
Overall, I definitely think it is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs, because the parents can provide a lot.	S_C2
 
I agree that it's a good idea for parents to offer monetary reward to their children when they have good performence in study.	S_T0
It help improve the students' grades further in two ways.	S_T1
One is that the students will be highly motivated to study, and the other one is that the students will also gain skills of money management.	S_T0
If the children are given diffrent amount of money due to their grades, apprehensively the student who get best grades will be likely to get the best reward, which will make the others admire him very much.	S_M1
The rest of the students will also work harder to improve their academic performance because they've already been promised that they will get as much money as he does as long as they reach the same grade.	B_S0
Additionally, it will even motivate some of the students who don't really care about thier grades to study for the money.	I_S0
The students in the class will therefore be more competitive as nearly all the students instead of  only parts of them are longing to be the best student, though a small proportion of students care more about the monetary reward they may be offered but less about the academic performance itself.	E_S0
Another good point is that children nowadays lask of the ability of managing their money.	S_M1
A lot of young students have no idea how difficult it is for their parents to make money to support the family, and would buy anything they like with out any slightly hesitation even if they are not born in an affulent family.	B_S0
Nevertheless, since the money given to reward their academic performance is limited, they will eventually learn that the only way to earn enough money to buy all the things they love is through hardworking, because they must have spend a lot of time and effort to get the satisfying grades.	I_S0
The next time they see someting attractive, they won't forget to take a glance at the price tag and then decide whether they should purchase it.	I_S0
This will save the parents even more money than they spend to reward them for their grades.	E_S0
 
An interesting discussion has aroused a controversy among public: children should spend more time on doing homework and praticipating some activities related to school or doing whatever they want.	B_T1
Althoug some people claim that children will feel boring if they spend more time on school's arrangement, I strong believe that it is great for children's future to spend more time on school's arrangement.	I_T1
My reasons and examples canbe elaborated as follows.	E_T1
Firstly, spending more time on doing homework or participating in organized activities related to school or sports will enable children to plan their time better.	S_M2
As children are young, it is kind of difficult for them to concentrate on something, which makes them usually spend little time on several activities.	B_S0
As a result, kids wil waste lots of precious time if they do not have a clear time planning.	I_S0
So it is indispensable	E_S0
 
Although many people may think it not necessary.	S_T0
But in my opinons  I think offering their school age children money for each high grade the get in is abuselutly a good thing for their school age children .	S_T1
First ，for most primery school students they are too little .	S_M1
And they can not manage their money,even they do not know what  supervise  actually is .	B_S0
so I  think  you can not let them to have too much money .	I_S0
beace is too early.	I_S0
And if you do this  .	I_S0
Maybe in the fucture ,it will makes him look down on money .	I_S0
And can not feel the hard feeling of earning that.	E_S0
Sencond ,the way to doing this can develop their  level of  adminstrate ability .	S_M1
And i think the age level abuselutly  conform to the level of mangement.	B_S0
It can let them became more and more brainy .	I_S0
also can help   them to thinking about mange arther things in our life .	I_S0
It is a good things that can let them know the importence of the  self government.	E_S0
FIN	S_S2
 
I want to show my opinion first: It does help on some conditions, but it's not a good idea.	B_T0
I hold the view that any smart parents won't do such things.	E_T0
The money that is given to high-grade children may stimulate their willing to pursue high grades, however, this function is temporary.	S_T1
As children are not mature enough, their opinions about values are not established completely.	B_S0
As a result, their parents' actions can influence them.	I_S0
For example, a child may consider study as a financial thing which can bring him money to spend, and then the incorrect view appears and grows.	I_S0
Finally, he will have a misunderstanding of study, which is quite terrible for their further study.	I_S0
What's worse, as most children don't have experiences of charging money themselves, the money that is given as a reward may become a waste on snacks and drinks in the end.	E_S0
Let's have a look at successful people who have good educations during their childhood.	S_M1
Most of them didn't get money but some encouraging words or books.	B_S0
Instead of giving money directly to children, taking the money to purchase some proper books for them is what I suggest parents to do.	I_S0
The proper books for the children can be useful for their growth and study.	I_S0
What's more, they will learn to have fun in reading, which much is better than spending money freely.	E_S0
That's how I think about the idea of giving money to reward children.	S_M1
In fact, the idea is common in China, as parents think it is the easiest way to reward their high-grade children.	B_S1
But I hope that they can have a correct way to educate their children.	E_S1
 
The issue of whether young people have more freedom to make decisions now is highly debtable.	S_I0
concerning to these situation, Some people hold the view that it is impossible for young people to make choice by themselves in the past.	S_T0
And some other contend that young people have the capacity of making decisions in the past.	B_T1
In the ultimate analysis, I side with the former.	E_T1
As you know, yound people depends less on their parents today for they learn more about the socity and they are more independent.	S_S2
First, we cannot deny the fact that young people have more methods to access to the society.	S_M2
To be more specific, they can reading the more books and browser the internet to get in touch with the differnt people ideas and lifestyles.	B_S0
Take myself as example.	I_S0
In the past I am a boy who is too shy to make decisions.	I_S0
However, with the time going by, I have more chance to communciation with the others such as traveling other palces through which I decide to become a archaeologist for I encounter a profeesor who introduce me some kowledge of archaeology.	I_S0
As a result, I firmly believe that young people have the capacity of making decisions today for they have more chance to know the world.	E_S0
In addition,It is not uncommonyoung people rely on their parents in the past for they cannot survive in the poor time by themselves.	S_C2
After all, having the chance to continue to their life is the most important.	S_S2
For instance, when you have not enough food to survuve, people tend to more rely	O
 
As a matter of fact,some parents using monet as a way to make students get higher grades.	S_I0
They think when students think they will get money if they get high grades,they will work harder.	B_T0
I have never experienced such things and I don't quite agree with this behavior.	E_T0
Frist of all,this behavior makes students consider more on the money instead of the knowledge which is opposites the purpose of education.	S_M0
When students study,they will become more and more thinking how much they will get.	B_S0
This lead to the problem that sometimes they try to get higher marks even though they have no idea what they are learning.	I_S0
What a terrible thing.	I_S0
Also,students may begin to associate education with money.	I_S0
The only purpose of studying may become getting more money.	E_S0
Secondly,it is not likely that students will always get money when getting high marks during their whole lives.	S_M0
It will become a problem when those students who get money when getting high grades enter a university or a collage.	B_S0
No longer can their parents give them money cause they may even in the different citis.	I_S0
Then when those students are not used to the satuation they get confused,thinking why they need to stduy or what they are studying for or even some worse qustion.	I_S0
Then what's next?	I_S0
Maybe not wanting to study.	I_S0
How can we expect those students to have good grates then?	E_S0
Last but not the least,we all need to study during our whole life.	S_M0
If I love study,then I will easily try to learn new things even when I am old.	B_S0
If I want to be better I also need to study more than those I need to prepare for the test.	I_S0
Everyone should have the knowledge of something they may never learn in the books.	I_S0
Only those having the concept of learning during the whole life are willing to these,and they will do better intheir lives.	E_S0
In a word,we don't need to use this way to encourage students to study.	B_C0
Instead,we need to let them understand to study for themselves.	I_C0
So,as far as I'm thinking,it's not a good way.	E_C0
 
I totally agree with the idea.	S_T1
Although many people considered that awaring children money is not a approximate method when they get a high grade，I have different opinion about this.	B_T0
I believe give children money can provide more advantage for children,such as encourage them to achieve more good grades,and help children establish a good financial concept.	E_T0
Firstly,offering children money when they obtain high grade in school can encourage them to achieve more and more high mark in future.	S_M1
Because many aware from parents are oral, it is relatively impractical, especially the children currently.	B_S0
The children are become practical as the development of society，and they often know what is they want.	I_S0
On the other hand, give money to them and let them choose something they like is the best way,if you don't believe it ,you can ask the school-age children,then you will agree with my concept.	E_S0
Secondly, awaring money to them can build up a good financial concept.	S_M1
The parents can monitor and help them to control the money.	B_S0
The children usually enjoy spend or deposit money by themselives,and the adults just take a little time to give them some advises about how to use the money.	I_S0
As children growth older,they may deposit a lot of money or may learned how to use this fund.	I_S0
It is really beneficial the children.	E_S0
In summary, I think the parents should offer children some money for they obtain  each high grade.	S_C2
Becuase it is	S_S2
 
This is always a problem that if you find a stranger who needs help,would you like to help him.	S_T1
In my opinion,more and more people are willing to help the strangers nowadys.	B_T0
There are two reasons.	I_T0
First,with the development of economy and technology,a large number of people have equipped withe the ability to help others.	I_T0
Second,because many people have taken good eduation that they have the sense of help struggling people.	E_T0
First of all,because the widely use of  Internet, we have many ways to get in touch with the struggling  person.	S_M1
The platform like Alipay and Wechat,they will put the information about the people who needs help.	B_S0
And if you want to help them ,you can easily find the necessary information.	I_S0
Because  the platform will carrify the reality of the information,which will also give helperus the cofidence and do not need to worry about the information is false,and believe the money or things they donated will be used propely.	E_S0
Secondly, we are taking highly of the eduation at present.	S_M1
As we all know,an important part of the education is to forgive others.	B_S0
We are supposed to thank the whole society which has take many efforts to raise us up.	I_S0
Education about the forgiveness makes us have the sense to help others.	I_S0
We feel happiness when helping strangers.	I_S0
Meanwhile, more and more famouse people like Pony Ma are involved in the charity activity which will also premote people to help others beacause we like to imitate the behavior of the people we admired.	E_S0
From what I have mentioned above, I can make a conclusion that people today are more like to help the strangers.	B_C0
We can easily find the the struggleing stranger.	I_C0
Many people are living a better life than the people in the past which make us have the ability to help others.	E_C0
Plenty of famous person are helping others frequently that are also promote people to help strangers because the famous people are like the flag of the society.	S_S2
 
With the development of the science and technology, the network has been improved  step by step, but the pubulic transportation in some place iss still not perfect.	S_T1
So i think the goverment shoud spend more money on the public trasportation.	S_T0
At first, the improvement of public transportation can reduce the air pollution.	S_M1
Some cities hav large population.	B_S1
If all the people use cars to travel, exhaust fumes froom hundreds of vehicles can harm the air.	E_S1
Second, good public transport can promote development.	S_M1
Public transportation is an important part of theurban landscape.	B_S0
With convinient transportation, people would like to visit this place.	I_S0
the development of tourism can promote the progress of many projects, such as handicrafts.	I_S0
For example, my hometown is a little city which has many historic buildings and beautiful views.	I_S0
But my hometown did not have convenient traffic and the economy is backward.	I_S0
However, one day the goverment gave us a lot of money to build subway railway stations and airport.	I_S0
So more and more people travle here , anf the city's economy grow up.	E_S0
 
Nowadays, most of people think that it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.	S_T0
Keeping the body health was the most important thing in this part.	S_T1
In this case I also support that opinion.	B_T0
Most of us know that doing physical exercise enable us to gain lots of advantage in our life.	E_T0
To begin with, by doing the phisical exercise, we can keep the body health.	S_M0
Doing exercise enable us to increase the body heat which can let us lose the bad things from your own body.	B_S0
If people do exercise every day, people will contain the regulation body system.	I_S0
For instance, a people have the serious cancer in hospital.	I_S0
And doctor tell him that he can not survive in the short time.	I_S0
By contrast, this patient can not give up, and he do the exercise every day.	I_S0
He run and jump actively.	I_S0
Long time past, the patient's body healty turn into the best way.	I_S0
In a result, people can keep in good healthy by doing the physical exercise.	E_S0
Additionally, doing teh physical exercise enable people increase the relationship between their friends.	S_M0
As we know, people like to do exercise with their friends.	B_S0
And then they can chat with each other.	I_S0
Thus this chance enable them to know their friends more deeper than before.	I_S0
For instance, I like go to the gym with my best friend, I can play the basketball, baseball and any other things.	I_S0
In the process of that time, we can communicate with each other, and explain the annoying things and delighted things which is happend in recently time.	I_S0
In a result, after the appoinment from the gym.	I_S0
Our relationship can get a big improvement.	I_S0
In conclusion, doing the physical exercise can give opportunities to people to improve the relationship.	E_S0
Adimittedly, I know that watching a movie also a good method to relax such as helping people to know enormorous knowlede for the movie or the book.	S_M0
However, I treat the body health as the most important thing.	S_S2
To sum up, doing the exercising enable people to have the exallent body system.	S_C2
 
Some parents believe in the money would make children's progress, and some parents think in another way.	S_I0
They both have their benefits of existence.	S_T0
However, I stand for the option which provides money for the children.	S_T1
Firstly, this motion would motivate children's ambition towards study.	S_M0
It's not bad, isn't it?	B_S0
The benefits of learning is not only the knowledge itself, but also the financial support.	I_S0
The children would most likely to study harder in order to get that money goal.	I_S0
As long as they get good grade, they would get the money or even freedom, and they could do whatever they want to.	E_S0
Secondly, this motion would help them plan their life.	S_M0
Before getting money, they have probably pay for this money equal value, namely, their grades.	B_S0
They have to study harder in order to get good grade, and change the good grades into money.	I_S0
This action also help them previously adapt the society, let the children know the truth that paying first instead of getting.	E_S0
Thirdly, this motion would develop the relationship between the parents and the children.	S_M0
It is not easy to understand, but the truth is that it does.	B_S0
As the parents offer the money, the children would get a feeling of being love by others, truely, this motion brews the harmony upon the relationship.	I_S0
If the children are insecure that time, losing his orientation, money would indicate a proper way indirectly by parents' purposes.	I_S0
Thanks to the money, the children would operate the money to what they needs, and let the parents know about what they need.	I_S0
In this case, the parents could find out what they missed to treat such a wonderful kid, and learn how to offer as well.	E_S0
In conclusion, I prefer the way to offer the money, so that there could be more benefits that were shown.	S_C2
 
I think rewarding school-age children who get a high grade with money is an effective practice.	B_T0
Reasons are as follows.	I_T0
Motivation is vital when people struggle to accomplish thier goals in providing them with energy and confidence.	E_T0
Motivation is usually generated by certian forms of rewards including money.	B_T1
Apply this theory to the case of the school-age children.	E_T1
They also need to be motivated in the long run of studying, and money, as a rewarding, can perfectly fulfill the aim of motivating children because they can, in turn, buy whatever they like afterwards.	S_T0
Second,money is not all bad.	S_M1
There is a strange belief in our society that things associated with money are not suitable to be exposed to children when they are forming their world values.	B_S1
however, as far as I am concerned, learning to manage money from an early age can better prepare a child for the futher when they have to step into the society which may seem unreal without the presence of money.	E_S1
finally, I think this practice will instill in the children the belief that effort pays off.	S_M1
at an early age when children do not know exactly what academic performance means for an individual's advancement in society, being rewarded with money which they can utilize to buy things they like or simply save for other purposes will give them a sense of achievement and thus will enable them to know that their effort pays off.	B_S1
and it is paramount and beneficial to bear this truth in mind because there may well be the possibility that a child may do not know how to perform better in school and will do nothing but wait for high grade to come itself.	E_S1
generally speaking, rewarding school-age children who get a high mark with money is beneficial to children both in thier academic work and in thier ability to manage thier money.	B_C1
moreover, it can also teach them the philosophy of life.	E_C1
 
I agree that parents should let children make mistakes and learn something from mistakes.	S_T0
In China, when a kid makes mistake, his parents often choose to beat him instead of telling him what he has done.	B_T1
This is not a valid way to educate kids, quite the reverse, it makes children hate their parents.	E_T1
As parents, they are responsible to educate their children.	B_S0
When children make mistakes, it means that they are not good at some aspects, they are not qualified to accomplish the task.	I_S0
Therefore, they have to learn some experience from mistakes so that they can finish the problem perfectly next time.	I_S0
This is also a sort of education for children.	I_S0
In this part,parents play an extremely important role.	E_S0
Children are young, they sometimes do not understand right or wrong.	S_M2
Likewise, they are not able to learn and prevent mistakes independently.	B_S0
In order to help them and lead them to do better next time after a mistake has been made, parents are necessary to teach them.	I_S0
When I was young, I made a big mistake that I ran to a place without a penny which was really far from my home, my parents knew this from neiborhood and were worried, they looked for me for an afternoon.	I_S0
After we were home, they did not beat me.	I_S0
Instead, they talked to me about the danger of running out alone, they asked me to stand in their shoes, which left a great impression in my mind.	I_S0
I knew I had done something wrong, I had to correct it and learn the danger of getting out of home alone.	E_S0
In the examplary true experience of mine above, I want to state that it is very necessary for parents to let kids make mistakes because it is efficient and feasible to engrave the experience and what parents want kids to know in their minds.	S_C2
 
"Which do you prefer,working together or alone?" when project is assigned, it's a question worth being asked to secure the efficiency.	B_I0
For me, I prefer working alone.	E_I0
Here are my three reasons.	S_T1
First,working alone can avoid useless comminication and save time.	S_M0
When a group of people work together, there must be a lot useless communication, in other words, conflict involved.	B_S0
Members will certainly argue for some useless details, which will waste a lot  of time.	I_S0
If I can work just by myself,it can be prevented.	I_S0
I can use these saved time to polish the solution, fix the problems, and so on.	I_S0
In this way I can make the project closer to perfect project.	E_S0
Second, I can gain more kinds of skills while carrying on the projects.	S_M0
When people work together,they may distribute works to members and everyone just only focous on his or her owm business.	B_S0
But if I can work alone,I can learn many kinds of skill, from the start of the project to the end.	I_S0
Even though I will make some mistake while trying, I can learn a lot at the end of the project.	I_S0
And it may not happen if I work as a team member.	E_S0
Thirdly, if a project is only undertaken by myself, I can control the whole project completely.	S_M0
I can slow down one section in order to wait for other sections, or abandon one sector to deal with unexpected trouble.	B_S0
It surely will cause many trouble in a team and waste a lot of time to communicate, like I just said above.	I_S0
But that is Ok if I just work with myshlf.	E_S0
It obvious that teamwork is useful in some areas,like members can work together and combine their abilities to get a breakthrough,or other many benefits.	B_C0
But I still am fond of working alone.	I_C0
Just like an old saying goes,"Being alone leads to success."	E_C0
 
Nowadays, many parents want their children to get good grades at school, so they might give their children some rewards to encourage them to countiued to do well in their study.	B_T1
In my opinion, it is a good way to give these children money for their success, but parents should also tell their kids that study and get good grades is not the only thing in their life, there still many other things in the process of their growth that they can pay attention to.	E_T1
Firstly, most students try hard to learn better,students always need encouragement , that might give them a sense of achievement that they will still want to try hard nest time.	S_M2
Secondly, some students are not good at study but they still try hard, they should be prasied for their hardworking and never give up.	B_S1
Generallky	E_S1
 
At present, there are many old and historic buildings in many cities.	B_I0
Some people think that the government should build new housing to replace these old buildings.	I_I0
That is because these historic buildings are useless for people's living.	E_I0
Others reckon that these old nuildings should be preserved to use on the development of economy.	B_T0
In my opinion, I support the latter standpoint.	E_T0
Above all, the government should keep the historic buildings to facilitate the development of economy.	S_M1
For example, the quadrangle dwellings in Beijing, China ought to be pulled down few years ago.	B_S0
But some officials insisted that the quadrangle dwellings should be preserved to develop the tourist trade.	I_S0
So the government gave them 5 years to earn money by using the quadrangle dwellings.	I_S0
They arranged prople to publicize the quadrangle dwellings and found the department to manage the tourist trade.	I_S0
Finally, they completed the assignment just 3 years.	I_S0
And now, the quadrangle dwellings are the one of famous buildings in Beijing.	I_S0
Therefore, the old and historic buildings are crucial for the economical development.	E_S0
What' more, the ancient dwellings can be used to advertise the culture of country.	S_M1
For instance, the Imperial Palace is well-known all around the world.	B_S0
It presents Chinese historic culture.	I_S0
Many foreigners are all coming to Beijing to visit the Imperial Palace and know the history of danasty in China.	I_S0
And most of them are shocked by the Chinese culture.	I_S0
When they go back to their country, they might tell their families and friends about China.	I_S0
As a result, more and more people will know the Chinese culture.	I_S0
So the ancient buildings represents a country's history.	I_S0
Reserving these buildings is a way to spread the cultural influnce.	E_S0
Conclusively, it's significant for the government to preserve old and historic dwellings.	B_C1
If these buildings are replaced by the new housing, the country will be short of the specific culture and one source of economy.	E_C1
 
I am agree that watching a movie or reading a book is a better way to relax than doing physical exercise.	B_I0
The reason of you want to relax is you are tired, and your body need some rest.	I_I0
At this moment, one will not want to do anything else, instead of stay on his or her bed and read books or watch movies.	I_I0
Becasue, ones body really need relax, and rest.	I_I0
Physical exercise mean do sports.	I_I0
If one doing physical exercise, his or her will even feel more tired.	I_I0
Because your body is keep moving and you will still feel tired, or even more tired than before.	I_I0
Stay in one place and read book, watch movies, are the best ways to let your body relax.	I_I0
Because at that moment, your body is totally realx and feel comfortable.	I_I0
You will think nothing and only enjoy the book or the movie.	I_I0
You will feel happiness when you read a book or watch movie.	E_I0
Physical exercise cannot let people feel totaly relax.	S_T1
Physical exercise will let you feel tired, that is why people said after sports you will need more sleep.	B_S1
When you are tired, you will never want to do some thing that will make you feel more tired.	E_S1
However, physical exercise is a good way to relax.	S_M2
But is not as useful as watching a movie and reading a book.	B_S0
Physical exercise is doing sports, and your bad emotion will release at this time.	I_S0
Usually, you will feel totally comfortable after you having sports.	I_S0
Your emotion is totally relased.	I_S0
Therefore, physical exercisae is a good way to relase your negative emotion but is not a good way to relax.	E_S0
For these kind of reasons, I think is better to relax by watching a movbie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.	S_C2
 
Nowsdays, young people must face many kinds of difficulties in this rapidly developing society.	S_I0
In my opinion, young people always meet some challage that too strict for them.	S_T1
Firstly, the emloyment pressure in that societies today is really high, young people must try to do everything best which they can do.	S_M0
In addition, there are too many young people but there are not always thave enough jobs for them, so young people must develop some other talents or get some outstanding achievement, otherwise they can not get a job.	B_S1
For example, one of my sister was graduated of a normal university last year, although she has a good grade in school and she is a very hardworking people, there are not any company wants her because she is just a unevevtful person.	E_S1
Secondly, the gap between the rich and the poor become more and more hard to overcome.	S_M0
The family which rich and powerful will spend a lot of money to nuture their children.	B_S0
Moreover, they can get more converience than other normal family, so it is really hard for those normal family's children to get good education in their childhood, when  they are grow up, they will find that there are too may people who are better then them and they only can stay in the same social bracket as their parents.	I_S0
There are only few people can break this rule to into a better ocial bracket.	E_S0
Finally, in today's society, most of people do not need to worry about how to survival, they bacome to worry about something else like spiritual level or living quality.	S_M0
When people need to think about these things, that means nowsdays young people will have a higher firld of vision than before, they become worry about the eqality of life and the life style.	B_S0
So they need to worry about buy a house or car and whether or not have enough money to have a baby or take care their parents.	I_S0
Such as myself, when oneday that i realize that maybe i can not have the same living quality after i adullt that i have to feed muself, so i must earn more money not just do not let myself survival.	E_S0
All in all, the rules that societies today expect young people to follow and obey are too strict, young people must face many things that they can not escape or avoid, the only thing they can do is be more hardworking and let themselevs better.	S_C2
 
In today's competitve sociaty, we cannot deny that people is long for success.	B_T1
Thus, for sellers, they will use variety methods to beautify their products in order to sell more objects and then making more money.	E_T1
Therefore,   in my opinion, I totally agree with that the products not seem much better than they really are.	S_T0
To begin with, making the products in advertisement look much better will attract more people to buy them.	S_M1
Needless to say, most consumers will consider the cost performance before they buy a product.	B_S0
If this prodcut cannot reach the consumers' standard, they will lose interest and even tell their friends do not buy the product.	I_S0
Thus, one of the tasks of the advertisement is to beautify the products and attract consumers.	I_S0
Take my mom for example, once she was washing a cloth, and she watched an advertisement about detergent intentionally.	I_S0
The advertisement said the detergent wloud remove the dirty, such as the oil, ketchup,  in second, and the advertisement also made an experiment to show the process about how to use the detergent.	I_S0
After watching the  advertisement, my mother thought that the detergent was magic and she ordered three detergents immediataly.	I_S0
In fact, although the detergent was useless after my mother bought it to home, my mother did not have chance to send it back.	I_S0
Thus, in order to attract people to consumer for the products, the advertisement will make the products seem much better.	E_S0
Moreover, because of the competition, the advertisement has to expand the advantage of the products.	S_M1
In fact, in one area, there are many products compete together.	B_S0
For shampoo area, there are at leat Panteen, Rojie and  head-shoulders companies compete with others; for computers area, there are at least  lenove, Samsung, Snoy companies compete together.	I_S0
Thus, in order to sell more products, the advertisement must makes the products much better than they really are.	E_S0
To sum up, not only for	S_S2
 
With the development of society, people are demanding more and more.	S_I0
Parents hop to cultivate their children into successful people, but many children are unwilling to study seriously.	B_T1
So parents thinks a loy of ways to reward their children and peomote them to study seriously.	I_T1
Most parents choose to pay money when their children get a high score.	E_T1
I do not think it is the best way to promote chilfren's learning, but it is also very effective.	S_T0
First of all, this method can promote children's active learning.	S_M2
Most children are very playful, and they cry and scream when their parents do not buy them what they want.	B_S0
On the other hand, at that time, parents tell their children that they can earn pocket money by studing hard, and most of the chidren will try to get high marks to get rewards.	I_S0
And in the process of learning, children can develop good  habits like high concentration in doing things.	E_S0
Second, some people may think that this method may lead to a idea of measuring everything with money when the children grow up, but I thinks the probability of this problem is very small.	B_C0
In elementary school and junior high school, parents can use pocket money as a reward accoding to children's scores in school.	I_C0
When the children go to high school, they will realize the important of learning.	E_C0
For example, my brother was very playful, when he was a child.	B_S0
His parents use pocket money as a reward for him to buy his favorite candy, but when my brother was in high school, all the students in the class were preparing for college entrance examination.	I_S0
Naturally, he did not need to rely on these money to urge hime to study.	E_S0
 
People's opinions are various，when it is come to whether should parent let children make mistakes and let them learn from that.	S_T0
Some parents seem feel hurt when their children make some mistakes or get hurted, so they will prevent their children from making mistakes .	B_T1
I think it will be benifitial for both parents and children when parents let kids to make mistakes,though.	E_T1
Initially, mistake can teach young men lessons.	S_M1
After making some mistake , young man can figure out that what cause the mistake and how to deal with it and make things right.	B_S0
However, if parents correct the kids before they make mistakes ,kids will not get this kind of experiences.	I_S0
And ,next time, kids will also depend on their parents' protection.	I_S0
When I was in primary school,I once forget to take my schoolbag with me.	I_S0
So I called my mother asking her to bring me it.	I_S0
What suprised me is that she refused to do so,  and told me to remember bringing it next time.	I_S0
I was critisized by the teacher that time but I learn to share the book with classmate and learn that everything need to depend on myself.	E_S0
Additionally, parents will benifit for that, either.	S_M1
When parents' kids don't live a happy life, parents do feel sad, too.	B_S0
By letting the kids experience the failure as early as possible, parents needn't to worry about children when they are old.	I_S0
I once see one of my classmates were totally under the protection of his parents .	I_S0
His parents will do anything for him, even when he make friends with others it is his parents to aks for others	E_S0
 
Travelling are becoming more and more popular nowadays, because people can learn a lot knowledge and experience different things during a journey.	B_T0
From my point of view, travlling to foreign countries are more beneficial to people than travelling in people's own country.	E_T0
First of all, travlling to foreign country can broaden people's horizon.	S_M1
When people travel to a foreign country, they can experience totally different customs from the customs in their own country while travling in their own country they may find it boring because it may be the same custom from where they come from.	B_S0
Then, they will get to know some local information about this foreign country, which can not be learnt from the internet.	I_S0
Last year, I went to Thailand for a trip.	I_S0
And fortunately, it was Thai new year at that time, so I joined local people to pour water on others, I was also poured.	I_S0
And the local people told me that the more welcomed you are, the more you will be poured.	I_S0
In this way, I learned a lot of local customs in Thailand.	I_S0
And if I hadn't been to Thailand, I would not have been able to know these amazing customs.	E_S0
Secondly, travelling to another country can make people learn some foreign language.	S_M1
When people travel to a completely different country where people speak totally different language from the country they come from, people will manage to live there trying to communicate with local people.	B_S0
During this process, people will gradually get to know a different language.	I_S0
And after some time, people may be able to speak and understand some of the language.	I_S0
Whne I was fifteen years old, I travelled to France, and I find that people sometimes will greet others though they don't know each other.	I_S0
So after greeting with some of the people in the hotel, I learned that people say bonjour to others when they greet.	I_S0
In this way, during the trip to France, I had the chance to get to know another language.	E_S0
To conclude, travelling to foreign countries can give people different experience from travlling in their own country, and they will be able to learn more.	S_C2
 
Do you like traveling in your own coountry or foreign countries?	S_I0
My answer will be the latter one.	S_T1
If we travel abroad, we can learn more culture about other countries and  also experience a brand new journey.	S_T0
In addition, we can also challenge ourselves in other countries.	B_S1
The specific reasons are mentioned below.	E_S1
Traveling abroad can help me inrease my ability of  communicating and making new friends.	S_M1
Take myself as an example.	B_S0
Three years ago, I had been to America with my school.	I_S0
Actually, that was my first time went abroad independently.	I_S0
Before I went there I was a really shy girl and only have a few friends, but I changed a lot after I traveled there.	I_S0
I communicated with a bunch of local students.	I_S0
We shared our own funny experiences and also talked about different cultures between China and America.	I_S0
I really spent an excellent time with all of them.	I_S0
And I also taught my friend Sally how to speak chinese.	I_S0
We had been extremely good friend.	I_S0
And until today, we have chatted with each other in Wechat.	I_S0
After It travel in foreign countries, I become more outspoking and outgoing.	I_S0
And now, I always have the most friends than the peers.	I_S0
I like travel abroad, because I can challenge myself really and have a big change.	I_S0
Therefore, traveling to foreign countries can improve my personalities and teach me how to communicate and make friends with others.	E_S0
In addition, traveling abroad can enrich my experience and expand my horizons.	S_M1
Indeed, traveling in our own country can also have this founction, but they are different really.	B_S0
In our own country, we can only learn something about some familiar things, but in the other countries we can learn some absolutely different culture and meet some different people who are not  same racial of us.	I_S0
My elder sister had been to Britain last year.	I_S0
She shared many thing with me.	I_S0
She said the people there are totally different than in China.	I_S0
The man there are aimed to be gentlemen.	I_S0
And she learned that the people there will late for their appointment, which is regarded as a polite behavior.	I_S0
Her view is expanded after she went there and she learnned many their culture which is different in China.	I_S0
Hence, traveling abroad have more benifit than in our own country.	I_S0
Choosing the latter one is better.	E_S0
From my perspective, traveling to foreign countries can really help us a lot than just travel in our country.	B_C1
We can not only enhance the ability of chatting and making friends, but also can rich our experience.	E_C1
 
Currently, many people prefer to stay at home and read books or play on their phones in their beds in their spare time.	B_I0
They think it is a perfect thing to do for relaxing.	E_I0
However, I think it is harmful for their health if they stay at home all day long without going out or exercising.	B_T0
From my perspective, doing physical exercise helps a lot with both our mental health and physical health indeed.	E_T0
It is absolutely better to do physical exercise for relaxing than watching a movie or reading a book for relaxing.	S_S2
One's mind and body will get comfortable while doing physical exercise.	S_M2
When I am annoyed by someone or bored for something, I would like to go out, get some fresh air, and do some physical exercise.	B_S0
I often feel that I can be reborn from doing exercise, because I feel like everything which is bad and bothers me a lot will all be swept away, and my mind is crystal clear while running.	I_S0
It also helps people to lose weight and become much healthier by exercising.	I_S0
Take my friend Lucy for example, she was overweight while in middle school.	I_S0
In the summer vacation before high school, she was determined to lose weight by exercising.	I_S0
She spent almost six hours in gym everyday, and she really changed a lot after that summer vacation.	I_S0
She became more charming than before, and all the sicknesses which came with obesity were gone.	I_S0
It is not difficult to see that how much help exercise can offer to both one's health and mind.	E_S0
On the contrary, if one does not do any exercise at all, and watch movies and read books instead, he or she will get unhealthy easily like his or her eyesights will fall, and one's weight will increase gradually, and he or she will become less good-looking.	B_S1
Some serious illness like high blood pressure will also happen to that person as a result.	E_S1
According what I have discussed above, it is definitely better to do physical exercise to relax than watching movies and reading books to relax since it does good to one's whole body and mind while exercising.	S_C2
 
Teachers do not only lead students to learn all kinds of knowledage but also give students some lessons aboout virtue all the time.	B_I0
Therefore most people state that teachers rather than friends will be likely to influence students.	I_I0
However, I cannot find my argument on this regard because students will spend more time with their friends.	E_I0
In addition, they are more willing to deal with their friends.	S_T1
First of all, students have more chances to contact with their friends, so that they are more influenced by their peers.	S_M1
To be specific, students always play computer games and go shopping on their spare time.	B_S0
During this time, they would like to  be accompanied by their friends.	I_S0
Thus, their friends have the possibility to decide which games they play and which kind of cloth they purchase.	I_S0
In addition, when it comes to study, students gain some education from teachers, and then they have to do some homework and researches with their friends.	I_S0
Although teachers serve as the leader during studying, students will occupy more time with their friends.	I_S0
When they make some researches, their friends' habits will influence them unconsciously.	I_S0
Thus I think the time that students spend with somebody will play an important role on the influence.	E_S0
What's more, students can accept their friends' suggestions for they are at the same age.	S_M1
To all students, there would be a deep gap between their teachers and them, which gives rise to their rebelling.	B_S0
For instance, my cousin stole his classmate's ball.	I_S0
And the teacher asked him to leave after class blaming on him.	I_S0
In addition, the teacher required my cousin to apologize to the classmate on p	E_S0

With the gradual development of society, there are more and more choices for people to select their favourable job, and people start to consider that : what kind of schedual should they take to work?	B_I0
3 days long- time work or 5 days short-time work?	E_I0
For my part, I prefer 5 days short-time work and I'd love to illustrate my reasons.	S_T1
First of all, admittedly, the further seems more attractive because 3 days work means we have more days to rest.	S_M0
After 3-day long-time work, we are exhausted and we eager for relax.	B_S0
However, I don't agree that we need 4-day rest a week.	I_S0
Hypothetically, I worked hard and felt terriblely need to rest.	I_S0
If I need to relax myself, I will do many things that i love to do, which will make me unreluctent to go back to work anymore because i rest too much.	I_S0
Thus the work time becomes miserable.	E_S0
Second, short-time work will create a  relaxing mood to finish the tasks easily.	S_M0
With the long-time job, we will feel tired and  the pressure originating from the work will reduce the efficiency.	B_S0
If we can seprate the tasks into several part, we can plan more methods to accomplish them effectively.	I_S0
For example, my friend Amy decided to write an eassy in one week and she wanted to finish it as soon as possible so she had a schedual of three-days.	I_S0
She told me she could not tolerant that time anymore with more than 12 hours sitting in the libarary.	I_S0
Then she changed the plan and she needed to finish that eassy in 5 days.	I_S0
After that change, she felt more relaxed and happier to write her article.	I_S0
She got A plus in the end.	E_S0
Last but not the least, if we choose to work 5days in a week, we have more attention on our work and we will love the time that we can rest ourselves.	S_M0
People always love those they do not have.	B_S0
Therefore, the less rest time we have, the more valuable the time is.	I_S0
After the work, we will figure out more entertaining staffs to make us delighted.	I_S0
Once, my brother had a long-term vacation after an important exam, he told me he felt boring, then my aunt asked him to participate an extracurriculum.	I_S0
After taking that class, he valued the time he could rest.	E_S0
Long-time work make us feel better.	S_C2
 
I disagree that relaxing by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.	B_T1
Our lives cant leave without each other,both of two are just the best way to relax.	E_T1
Nor everyone will desagree with my view,but I will confirm what I thing is right with helpful reasons.	S_M1
Firstly,If we only play physical exercise,can we deserve the real relaxing?	B_S1
Doing exercise exactly make a person physical relaxed ,but the more physical exercise will lead a tired body.	E_S1
The second one:if we just watch a movie or read a book instead of exercises,can we deserve relaxing?	S_M1
That is also the question for us,reading or watching for a long time consume more head energy.	S_S2
what is the best way to relax ourselves,combing two relaxing ways,that which is the correct way to be relaxed.	S_C2

I agree with the satement: Parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.	B_T0
Making mistakes is the most natural way for children to learn and to develop a mature mind.	E_T0
Firstly, When someone make a misake, he or she will learn quicker from the mistakes.	S_M0
The mistakes a child made at a young age will be remembered for a longer time.	B_S0
In my case, my mom always says when she was young nobody told her to keep the manners.	I_S0
She was being shouted at for not having a good manner.	I_S0
She still remember the events and said they are beneificial to her life.	I_S0
However, when she teaches me to keep my manners, I always need to be reminded many times.	E_S0
The second reason for parents to let children make mistakes is that if children make few mistakes, they will not know what to do when they face a difficulty when they grow up.	S_M0
Parents should not only let children learn from the mistake itself, but also to learn that faliure occours sometimes, and the best way is to overcome them because nobody can help.	S_S2
Thirdly, Letting children learn from mistakes is a good way to help them develop thinking skills to reflect and conclude.	S_M0
The skill is exceptionally important.	B_S1
When a child makes a mistake, parents should help them how to avoid such mistakes next time, and so he child can avoid the same kind of mistake.	E_S1
In conclusion, parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes because that is a most efficient way to teach.	B_C0
It can also help children get stronger and help them have the abiliey to reflect on that they have learned.	I_C0
Parents sould not hold on to their children and protect them from the unkown world.	I_C0
They should allow them to go and explore themselves.	E_C0
 
As the saying goes"The book is the ladder of the progress of mankind",books play an important role in our life.	S_I0
As far as i am concerned ,it is reading a book or watching a moive that can make me more relaxing.	S_T1
Initially,there are lots of stories which can absorb me in books and movies.	S_M1
Every book or movie contends the author's personal thought as well as his own life,which are shared according his words.	B_S0
It is impossible for a man to travel to every corner in the world ,however ,leading by book and moives enable you to reach it.	I_S0
In my opinon,reading a book after a whole day working is the most relaxing experience i could imagine.	E_S0
Secondly,comparing with the hard physical exercise,reading and watching give little difficulty to our body.	S_M1
No matter how old  you  are or how health you are,reading is what your body can afford.	B_S1
What's more, the tired exercise always force you to sleep to relax your body, which increase the load on you.	E_S1
In spite of doing much exercise is not great, the basic sport is necessary for you.	B_C0
Without the sport, your body will break down thus the reading has no mean.	I_C0
In a word,reading or watching will bring your mind to the world or some palce out of the world,which will relaxing me a lot.	E_C0
 
I think parents should not offer their children money for high grade in school .	B_T1
Because childern should learn the knowladge in their suitable grade.	I_T1
The school-age childern should make friends and have a hobby also.	E_T1
As we know,Have some good friends are good for chirdern in their life.	S_M2
Good friends can help childern solve the peoblem and share the life.	S_S2
 
From my perspective, relax by doing physical exercise is as good as relaxing by watching a movie or reading a book.	S_T1
Which way is better depends on what kind of joy you want to acquire.	S_T0
There are studies inditcate that doing physical excercise can increase the amount of some chemicals in our body, which can bring us the feeling of happiness.	S_M1
And some people really enjoy the statement of sweating during fierce exercise.	B_S0
They forger all worries when they are concentrating on exercising.	I_S0
In addition, doing excercise may help us shape our bodies and improve the health condition, which can also bring us joy and confidence.	I_S0
However, if you are exhausted after  lots of physical work, doing exercise might not be a good choice to relax.	E_S0
In this way, we can choose watching a movie or reading a book instead.	S_M1
Watching a movie or reading a book can totally relax our body.	B_S0
And it can bring us mental joy as well.	I_S0
When we feel lonely, we can enjoy warmness by watching romantic movies.	I_S0
When we are traped in dilemmas and feeling confused about the future, the biographies of celebrities are able to bring us faith and courage.	I_S0
We are able to experience different lives through movies and books and they help us see the world outside our daily lives.	I_S0
That is a really fantastic advantage.	E_S0
Thus, if you want to improve your health condition, you can choose physical exercise.	B_C0
And if you want to enjoy a spirit tour, you can choose a movie or a book.	I_C0
They are both able to reduce your stress and help you relax.	E_C0
 
At present, with the development of society, people can acquire an increasing number of knowledge.	B_T0
Some people contend that young people cannot influence decisions, whcih will bring about a large number of benefits to our society.	I_T0
others are in favor of the viewpoint that young people is the major decision maker for our society's rules.	E_T0
Nonetheless, I prefer the latter view.	B_T1
My reasons and examples are listed as follows.	E_T1
initially, young people would bring about more labor force for our society.	S_M0
This is because young people possess more energy, so they can sustain more work than older people.	S_S2
An equally significant fact is that young can use their knowledge to more prople.	S_M0
this is due to a fact that young people will be educated in university.	B_S0
they can obtain a large amount of knowledge form this place.	I_S0
Therefore, they can utilize this knowledge to make some beneficial decisions, which will range form sciense to literiture.	I_S0
For instance, in my universitym	E_S0
Undoubtedlly, young people also have their own problem.	S_M0
This is because nowadays a large number of university student cannot find a job in the society, they might not engage in some jobs which match with thier major.	B_S0
However, these problems also will influence our society's future, which means our society should make some decision to resolve these problems.	I_S0
Thus, young student can find some jobs through these decisions and they can enable our society to become more better.	I_S0
Hence, they will influence our society's future.	E_S0
All in all, theoretically and practically speaking, young people influence on the significant decision that determine the future of society, which is indisputably correct.	B_C1
Not only young people is our society 's major labor force, but also they have more knowledge from their educated school.	E_C1
 
I agree the statement that all university students should be required to take history courses no matter what their field of study is.	S_T1
Every country has their own history.	B_S0
And everyone of the country should know about their history.	I_S0
History is not the last period of the country , it can also incidate the future of the country.	I_S0
History is not only important to a country but also to society and personaility.	I_S0
We always look back, so we can watch the future better.	I_S0
No matter what job you will take in the future,you should learn about the history cleanly.	I_S0
Because it is not the requirment for another job,but a requirment for a person.	I_S0
Everyone should know about the history,eapecially our university syudents.	I_S0
Education is very important to a country.	I_S0
So the history education is also keep in the whole education of students.	I_S0
And it is the most obvious way to help students to know about the history by taking the history courses.	I_S0
The teacher can help students learn about the history more corrcetly and cleaner.	I_S0
Students also have a change to talk about the history and exchange their ideas.	I_S0
Knowing more about history is great for their development.	I_S0
So history courses is better for not only countries but also for sutdents themselves.	I_S0
And I think the history courses is very necessay.	E_S0
 
What role do you play in today's society?	B_I0
And do you think  whether one of your decisions will affect the whole society as a young people?	E_I0
From my perspective, youngh people are the hope of the society and so their decisions will exert immense influence on the future of the world.	S_T1
The society will be weirded by young people when they grow up and all the old man will loose their function because new things will definitely replace old one.	S_M2
The best exemple  to illustrate this state is Lincoln's own experience.	B_S0
Because of the dreamto be a presiden when he growed up, he decided to learn politics, which was extremely difficulte and all his failily menbers opposed his decision.	I_S0
After having experienced a bunch of setbacks, his dream had come true and enhance the development of America a lot.	I_S0
Although Lincoln presented many year ago, today's young people is also the same because they have the same characteristic whcih is they are potential.	I_S0
It looks like that he is only a tiny identity compared with the whole world, but his important decison really changes America.	I_S0
That is because the future of society is misterious and no one konws that what will happen.	I_S0
Young people are always the potential funtion to the society, so just one of their minimal decision can prosper the whole world.	E_S0
Young people are the main constituent of this society and thus the decison of their future thought view can totally alter the world.	S_C2
Take the Chinese president Xi as an example.	B_S0
When he was young, he chose to believe the idea of the Communist Party, which is heart thought for current China.	I_S0
No one will konws that his decision will cause such important effect on  the whole China.	I_S0
That is to say, every young people's decison are essential and people should cherish every decison young people make.	E_S0
 
Nowadays.	S_S2
Many people want to change styles of their lives.	B_I0
Like, working five days a week to only work three days but long hours.	I_I0
In my opinion, I would like to work five days a week .	E_I0
I will give three specific exmaples.	S_T1
Firstly.	S_M0
I can more efficence work in a long term.	B_S0
If I work three days a week, I might feel very stressful.	I_S0
I can not work and remenber too many a day, then, my effitient will become lower.	I_S0
But, if  I work five days a week, I can have enough time to clean all the stuff I did, I can get normal rest time, my life is more rules.	E_S0
In additional.	S_M0
Working five days a week I will not easy forget what Iearn in this week.	B_S0
I remenber when I was in an chinese festival, I only need to work three days a week.	I_S0
During the holidays was very happy.	I_S0
But after the holidays, I forgot what I learned before.	I_S0
I wasted more time too review.	E_S0
Last but not least.	S_M0
If I work three days a week, I might easy do not want to study after that.	B_S0
When I was in middle school, there were too clold outside, so , the school decided to give us two days holidays.	I_S0
And these two days connect with weekend, so I just play on video games at home.	I_S0
When I come back to school, I always thought about video games, during that month, I failed many classes.	I_S0
To put in a netshell.	I_S0
I prefer to work five days a week for short hours.	I_S0
I can work more efficence during five days.	I_S0
I will not easy foget what I learn before.	E_S0
And I will more concentrate on my works, do not distracted by video games.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, everbody will make mistake, such as teacher, leader even professional in their own filed.	S_I0
When they make mistake some people think should immediately interrupt and correnct the mistake rifht way, and others believes that should say nothing.	S_T0
As for me, l perfor the wait until the class or meeting is over and the people are gone , and then talk to the teacher or meeting leade.	B_T1
And my reason will be analyze following paragraph.	E_T1
First of all, l think wait until the class or meeting and then talk is bester way, because it show respect the teacher,  and also aviod embracasment for each others.	S_M2
Which the teacher will have  a good impression for the student.	B_S0
And after finish the class the teacher is willing to talk with student.	I_S0
if someone immedietely to interrupt the teachers the teather will feel the  very embrarrane, which will be very disrespect for teacher.	I_S0
For example, in a meeting, the meeting leader propose a data for employee, but l found this data was incorrect, after meeting finish l told the leder this data has interrect, the leader accept my opnion, then she feel l m respectful and intaligita.	I_S0
So l think the the second one is best way.	E_S0
Second, the waiting the class or meeting finish is bester way, because l can talk about my opinion with the teacher, the teacher will told me my opinion whether is righ.	B_C1
If l say nothing l will feel my opinionis righ and the teather is incorrect.	E_C1
After when l face a same task l may mistake again.	S_S2
 
I don't agree with this statement.	B_I0
Nowadyas,  an inceasing number of people are puzzled with the intense pressure in their life , the sharply rising house price, the difficult exam, those complicated questions filled people brain, so that they have no time to do anything wasting their time.	E_I0
Firsly, helping stangers may have some unknown risks, when you decide to help a elder lying on the road painfully, you may be accused to be the person who result the elder be injured.	S_M0
Which may bring with various terrible problems in your life, paying for the treatment, being responsible for the accident and so on.	B_S1
So people alwasy chose to hide ther mercy, igonre those people in need, in order to, ensure their themselve security to physical and mental extent.	E_S1
Further more, in this result-oriented era people always give priority to the so called succeed, the standards can be used to measured a person are framed too tightly, we just focus on the salary, the grades, or something like thses.	S_M0
So there is no extra time for people to attach their attention to those strangers.	S_S2
Finally, people's sense of independet is stronger than ever before, we always take apart of oursevles form the crowd to be an exactly unique unit.	S_M0
People gradually make sense that the resource is limited but the amount of people is infinite, so more and more people tend to quit sharing and helping, but just strive to acquir and hold more resource for their own.	S_S2
All in all, even though it is heard sorrowful, there is no denying that more and more people decline to help a stranger recently.	S_C2
 
In the contemporary society, there is more and more species that are nearly distinct, and larger and larger wild areas are used for human activities such as buildings, or agriculture.	B_I0
However, the increasing number of human activities will damage the habitats and the quality of daily necessities of animals.	E_I0
As a result, these actions may cause some irrevearsible consequeces that may have the effects of human.	S_T0
Though some people may think the protection of wild animals and wilderness area may waste of money and time, it is still important to do including saving the environments and inhibit the damage of food chain.	S_T1
My general point of view relies on the primary reason that prortectwild animals and wilderness areas can make our environments get better.	S_M0
People build up more and more buildings and constructions nowadays, ao we need to expand the area to urban areas.	B_S0
However, the number of habitats of animals will decreases, animals will have a decreasing population.	I_S0
Also, the species of animals will have a reduction.	E_S0
The second is that, if  the government do not protect wild animals, that may cause the damage of food chain.	S_M0
Some of the animals play a really important role in the food chain.	B_S0
If one of them distinct, then the following animals will ahve a large increasing number of population, and the lasting species of animal of the distinct animal will also nearly dinstinct.	I_S0
For example, if the snakes are distinct, eagle will be also distinct because they have nothing to eat, they will have a reduction in the population.	I_S0
And also, the number of rabits will increase, because the number of their preditors decreases.	I_S0
This situation will cause the imbalance of food chain, the oversize of any species population will cause the disadavantages of human.	E_S0
However, if governments protect these animals and wilderness areas, that will need large amounts of money and times.	S_M0
And these money and times can be used to build more buidings, and do more experiments originally.	B_S1
However, if the costs of money can help people have a better environments to live, and have a more balanced food chain that provent events, these cannot be called a waste of money.	E_S1
From what we have discussed above, although governments protect animals and areas may have a spending of money, but that not only for human to have better environments, but also	O
 
I don't agree with this statement,because I think it's may be a good way to relax by reading a book but it's definitely a effective way to relax by doing physical exercise.	B_T0
However,you'd better not watch a movie when you want to relax.	E_T0
We all have to relax,especially after a along period of work which is more and more tedious regarded by us,so we try our utmost to rest both our brains and our bodies,both physically and mentally.	S_M0
But after a seemingly exciting movie,the odds are that we feel more dizzy than before,or our eyes become more sour than before.	B_S1
That's because we have to concentrate on each act and we really don't want to be ignorant of any details,which means we don't relax ourself at all,neither physically nor mentally.	E_S1
Then you may swing to reading,which might be a good way in some people's point of view.	S_M0
They argue that at least we can immerse ourselves in a totally different world when reading between the lines,so it's at least good for our bodies.	B_S0
It's true,to some extent,but I think it's not so good for our eyes.	I_S0
How can we stop reading after only one or two episodes?	I_S0
Your eyes will finally hurt as time goes.	E_S0
So I think we may as well doing physical exercise while relaxing.	S_M0
It's good for eyes,of course.	S_S2
And consider doing a totally different kind of thing	O
 
In this day and age, it is commonly acknowledge that the rules that societies today expect has been playing a piovtal role in young people's education.	B_I0
The first issue of whether the rules that societies today expect young people  to follow and obey are too strict has sparked off pirited debate among individuals.	I_I0
People view it differently due to their dissimilar background and experiences.	I_I0
from my point of view.	I_I0
I prefer that the rules for yopung people are not too strict.	E_I0
Indeed, there are many factors can resulted the strick rules for young people, such as the developmemt of societies require that young people need to learning and following more things.	B_M0
But, there are two reson that why i disagree with the statement.	E_M0
First and foremost, there are many reactions can help young people fleeting from the rules.	B_S0
According to the development of technology, more interesting things have invented to relieve the stress of young people, such as computer games, television shows.	I_S0
My cusion sister Joanna can be a good example.	I_S0
When she was study in the school, the school had many strick rules and student must obey them.	I_S0
That resulted of  students in her school were very tired and unlively.	I_S0
But after she came home, she can play computer games and watch television shows to release her emotion.	I_S0
That's why she think the rules inher school are acceptable.	E_S0
For another, the modern societies can accept varies concepts and ideas.	S_M0
Because of the openness of our now societies, more people include children and old people can accept the concepts or ideas that they totally can not believe in the past.	B_S0
Of a result, young people can told their strange thinkings to others even they are children or old man.	I_S0
Thus, young people can live mor relax, and do not worry about others feeling.	E_S0
frome these reasoms, we can safely conclude that the rules for ypung people are not too strick and  they have more signoficant influencial on young people's education.	B_C1
Without them, it is almost unlike to controlling the young proplr in our societies.	E_C1
 
Currently, it prevails in many places that young people are different from they used to be.	B_I0
Whether young people are more independent today has been an issue of public interest and concern.	E_I0
As for me, I am firmly convinced that an increasing number of young people can make dicisions themselves.	S_T0
Firstly, in the past, young people need to depend on their parents to make dicisions because they are lack  of money, ability, and experience.	S_M0
But now, everything changes very quickly.	B_S0
Sometimes parents' opinions are not useful anymore.	I_S0
Take my friend James for example, he used to be a good child, depending onhis parents' words very much.	I_S0
However, one day, it comes to a special assignment which needs new ideas.	I_S0
With his parents always tell him to just listen to class and follow his teachers, James can not have any creative thought.	E_S0
Secondly, parents may not have the ability to help their children to make dicisions.	S_M0
As I have mentioned above, time is changing.	B_S0
Today' s young people may have a more broaden horizon than their parents.	I_S0
Moreover, they can have more knowledge about the world, whatever living skills, monetary skills, or working skills.	I_S0
For instance, many young people's parents have no idea about electric products and thay don't know how to use these products.	I_S0
But now it' s elecric time, isn't it?	E_S0
Third, is about the community's attitude.	S_M0
People are widely believed that young people shouldn't depend on their parents too much.	B_S0
Today's education and environment enourage young people to be independent and do everything by themselves.	I_S0
I am an example.	I_S0
Once I always do something after asking my parents, I will be considered to be useless.	E_S0
To sum up, I believed that today young people are better able to make decisions about their own lives.	S_C2
 
As we all know, some Chinese parents are very strict with their children and don not allow them to make even one mistake.	B_T1
But as far as I am concerned, parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn form their own mistakes.	E_T1
There are three reasons which I approve as follows.	S_T0
Firstly, no one is perfect and never makes miistakes.	S_M0
There is no doubt that every one will make mistakes let alone children.	B_S0
When parents ask children not to make mistakes and punish them after children make mistakes, children who are sensitive will be more self-abasement and afraid to do anything else.	I_S0
As a result, children will be negetive about their whole lives.	E_S0
Secondly, no failure, no growing.	S_M0
As the saying say, no pain, no gain.	B_S0
Unless we meet failure and go through the hard time, our soul will not grow up.	I_S0
The failure is the mother of the sucess.	I_S0
Almost every parent want their children to be elites.	I_S0
But they maybe overlook the effects of mistakes and exaggerate the advertages of perfection.	E_S0
Thirdly, children who are under heavy stress will be disappointed and not be dymatic to chase for what they want let alone what their parents want.	S_M0
If parents want to give their children an unhappy life, they can command their children not to make mistakes.	S_S2
In a word, parents who don not allow chileren to make mistakes let children be negetive and have less chance to find their happy life.	B_C1
However, children who make mistakes and learn a lot from them by the help and encouragement of parents will find thier happiness ea	E_C1
 
Nowadays, some parents choose to offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.	S_I0
As far as I am concerned,it is not a good idea to encourage students to learn and get good grades.	S_T1
There are some reasons.	S_T0
To begin with, in order to get more money, students may haave more motivations to cheat in the exams.	S_M2
It is harmful to build a good exam atomosphere.	B_S0
Besides, it will make children more dependent on the parents' money.	I_S0
If children get used to gain money from their parents because of their high grades,they will think the money is easy to get and become more dependent.	I_S0
What's more, it waste parent's money which can be used in more useful place and have more function.	I_S0
For example, parents can use the money to buy more useful books for children or let children have more interest chasses which is more beneficial to their development and future.	E_S0
In summary, offering school-age children money for each high grade the get in school is not a good idea.	B_C0
It will not only make children more dependent on their parents, but also let them have more motivations to cheat in tne exams.	I_C0
In my oppinion, parents can share more time to acompany children and teach them rather than offer them money for their high grades to help them improve their grades.	E_C0
 
Some people thought it was easier to identify what type of career or job would make them have a successful future.	S_I0
But I hold an antagonic answer to this question for two reasons that the development of technology and we have more choies today.	S_T0
The first and formost reason to support my standpoint is that the technology development caused people determine what job can let people have a successful future.	S_M1
As is konwn to all, we can konw the news very easy on nework and we can konw wihch job is the most hot and has a great future  rencently.	B_S0
But in the past, no one would told you about which is the best work for future development.	I_S0
For eaxmple, many of the news  about the artificial intellegence such as the new discovers and new inventions of this subjects show that the world tend to artificialize, so it helps people to determine which is the best work for them and their future.	E_S0
To back up my point,It would be another relevant reason to support my answer is that we have more choices to choose today.	S_M1
Needless to say, today people have creat many jobs that we did not  have in the past.	S_S2
take the articicial intellegence as an example again, we will not even to emagain that the roberts have their own thoughts before but now w	O
 
Nowadays, we may have accustomed with learning from teacher and memerize the knowledge from them.	S_T0
However, it is not the most effective choice, for we may find we always forget what we have learnt and was pushed to learn it twice.	B_T1
We always get fustrated and unwilling to keep on learning.	E_T1
While, if we learn from our own mistake, all these disadvantiges would be avoided.	S_T0
therefore,  I think students should learn from their mistakes.	S_S2
Firstly, learning from ones'  mistakes is effective.	S_M0
Because some of knowledges presented by teachers might be what we have knowed.	B_S0
Learning those for several times is a waste of time.	I_S0
While, where we make mistakes is what we have to focuse on, for these are where we are weak in.	I_S0
They are exectly what we should change.	I_S0
When I was ten years old, my teacher always emphesized that math is the most important subject in the furture life, so she made us spent plenty of time to exercise math.	I_S0
However, I always made mistakes on English rather than math.	I_S0
Keeping pace with teacher wasted my plenty of time.	I_S0
Finally, I realize the importance of finding my own mistakes, and learn from it, and I got a better grade.	E_S0
Secondly, It is hard to avoid children making mistakes, when children make a mistake, we should let them learn from it.	S_M0
Everyone has made mistakes, we can't avoid children making mistake.	B_S0
When we try to avoid making mistakes, it' hard to make progress.	I_S0
I used to avoid mistakes to perform a good students, and later I found, I have to think twice when I make any dicisions.	I_S0
It is quite exhusted and even though I can't make perfect choices at any situations.	I_S0
Then I know making mistakes is does not matter, only if I learn from it and won't make a mistake at another time.	E_S0
Finally, letting children making mistakes allow parents know more about their children.	S_M0
Due to children are different, children will make various mistakes, but each individual is unique.	B_S0
therefore.	I_S0
Therefore, when parents let children and let them learn from it, parents can learn more about their children and render unique teaching method for them.	I_S0
Thus, children can get a better education.	E_S0
To sum up, Parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.	B_C1
In this way, children can get more progress comparing with merely learning from books.	E_C1
 
In this society, celebrities have high status, and many people take their words seriously.	S_I0
Many people think that the opinion of celebrities, such as famous and athletes, are more important to younger people than they are to older people.	B_T0
However, I tend to disagree with this statement for several reasons.	E_T0
Fisrt, the opinons of celebrities may not right.	S_M1
The celebrities are not saint so they might say something from their own perspective, which is not good for the teenagers.	B_S0
For example, Han Han, one of the most famous writer in China, once said that he thinks learning math is useless and it is enough to just take math courses before junior school.	I_S0
By listening to his opinion, the teenagers who do not like math will comfirm their ideas that math is useless and they are likely not to study hard on math which may cause bad influence on their study.	I_S0
However, we all know that math is important for building our logic.	I_S0
In that case, the opinons of celebrities are not right sometimes and thoes opinions may have a bad effect on younger people.	I_S0
Nevertheless, older people have better discretion, so they will able to diffrentiate truth and fault.	E_S0
Second, celebrities may be forced to give some opinons by commercials.	S_M1
The teenager who like  following their icons always believe in what they say.	B_S0
When the celebrities say that one product is great, they may be paid to say so.	I_S0
The teenagers may believe in their words and buy the products the celebrities recommend, which might be a waste of money.	I_S0
Since we all know that the words for advertising are not all real, the opinions from the celebrities might mislead the younger people.	I_S0
The younger people always quite believe the celebrities while the older people are more objective, therfore they will not take the words of celebrities seriouly.	E_S0
To sum up, I disagree with the statement that he opinion of celebrities, such as famous and athletes, are more important to younger people than they are to older people.	B_C1
This is because the opinion of celebrities may not right and the celebrities might say some words for advertising.	E_C1
 
Recently, the controversial topic has aroused a heated debate: during economic crisis, which one the goverment should reduce: library, police or public transportaion?	B_I0
The opinion varies from person to another.	I_I0
Some claim that library should be cut down, others hold the view that the police is less imporant than other choice, so that it should be reduce.	E_I0
However, contrary to their view my comes my perspective that pubic transportation should be reduced.	B_T0
My reasons are elaborated as follow.	E_T0
Firstly, the goverment has to distribute various money to make sure the transportaion in the good condition.	S_M1
Because comparing with the private transporation, such as car, choosing the public transporation is able to save a lot of money and prevents the people from the heavy traffic.	B_S0
So more and more people prefer to take the public transportation in the daily life, which cause the unavoidable damages and consumption of the public facilities.	I_S0
In order to repairing the equipments, the goverment has to afford a heavy burden, leading to a unavaliable budget during economic crisis.	I_S0
For example, in my homwtown, many worker choosed to take a bus to the hill because of the cheeper prise.	I_S0
After a long time use, the bus was in the bad conditon: some chairs were borken, the glasses was full of dust, and the max speed of the bus apparently slowed down.	I_S0
So the goverment spends many money to repair and update these buses, which makes the government has no money to build a new city park.	E_S0
By contast, the library and the police play a vital role in the urban city, espacially during economic crisis.	S_M1
library could preserve a lot of resourses, which is helpful for peolple to acquire the useful information.	S_S2
As we a	O
 
Maybe, at the begining, it can encourage children to study hard.	B_I0
But, in the long run, I don't think it is a good idea.	I_I0
Why?	I_I0
As we all know, knowlege is invaluable .	I_I0
Just like Bacon said "knowlege is power!"	I_I0
Yes,knowlege is our tool to change the world.	I_I0
We can't make the knowlege equal to money.	I_I0
Tt's too utilitsrian.	I_I0
At the meantime,this kind of behavior will mislead children.	E_I0
That's not what we want to see.	S_T1
What's more!	B_S0
Money is not everything.	I_S0
Parents can't set a bad concept.	E_S0
On the other hand, is a high mark everything?	S_M2
We all know, good grade not means you have learned a lot of knowlege.	B_S0
Parents just claim the mark is a wrong decision in essence.	I_S0
No one can always to be excellent.	I_S0
Parents just pay attention to source, children will become misunderstanding, or worse, they maybe learn to lie.	E_S0
This way can briefly generate children's interest to study.	B_C0
But it will badly affect children's psychology and growth.	I_C0
Do more harm than good.	E_C0
 
Parents want their children to succeed in school.	S_I0
They konw that doing well in school is good for children in the future.	B_T0
That's why they decided to do all they could to help their children finish school.	E_T0
However, in my opinion, giving money to a child for every high grade is the worst thing if parent do.	S_T1
It may have some short-term consequences, but its devastating impact on children's lives is huge.	S_T0
To make an activity enjoyable, you should do it for that activity.	S_M0
This is what most religious and spiritual approaches emphasize.	B_S0
If you just climb to the top, you won't enjoy the journey.	I_S0
Climbing is only a means to an end.	I_S0
In a similar way, if a person does something just for mony, when he feels he has made enough money, he will stop doing it.	I_S0
Therefore, it is wrong to associate activities such as learning, exercising and healthy eating with money.	I_S0
To be successful, one needs to continue doing these activities in life.	I_S0
For example, I used to do well in shcool just to get good grades and make my parents happy.	I_S0
Although their attention made me happy for a short time, it didn't make me happy when I was studying materials.	I_S0
However,when I started to enjoy the materials and study for the sake of learning, I was very happy while studying, which meant a lot of time in the day.	E_S0
On top of that, if parents donate money without knowing what it's for, it can cause serious problems for their children.	S_M0
If a child needs to buy something, he should ask his parents for money.	B_S1
In this way, parents not only make sure the child really needs the item, they also check if it's appropriate for the child to have it at this age.	E_S1
In addition,it can encourage children to indulge in shopping.	S_M0
When parents give their children money, they send messages to buy things with that money.	B_S0
Spending money because you have some money in your pocket, rather than thingking about what you really need, will lead to excessive shopping bad havits in the future.	I_S0
Today, many young people are in debt ceacuse they don't learn to stop shopping when they buy what they need, but shop shopping when they don't have money on their credit card.	E_S0
Generally speaking, giving money to a child with good grades has a lot of negative effects on his life.	B_C1
I think parents should strive for the value of their children's knowledge and enable them to recognize and cherish the opportunities they gain by entering such schools and the education system.	E_C1
 
Education has become increasingly significant in the growth of teenagers since it is hard to make distinguished accomplishement due to the fierce competition in study and job employment.	B_I0
It is also an era when the general living standard has improved greatly, so parents can divert their energy from working to educating their children.	I_I0
To deal with children's mistakes in developing habits ans forming social values, parents have developed controvercial ways to teach their children to behave well.	I_I0
Some avoid their children from forming unhealthy lifestyle, while others let their children correct their misbehaviors on their own.	E_I0
From a personal perspective, the first solution is quite efficient and time saving when facing the social condition of rapid natural selection.	S_T1
In the first place, parents are occupied with accumulated experience of socialization and employment.	S_M1
It would be better if they can point out potential danger or traps to prevent their children from making mistakes that was irreversible.	B_S0
To make it more explicit, parents can teach children how to be behave well when communicating with others and how to deal with different type of social problems, using their rich resource and skills.	I_S0
For example, my mother always asks me to hang out with my friends to enhance friendship.	I_S0
As a result, I form the habit of playing with my friends and chatting with them.	I_S0
They describe me as a kind and outgoing person and they often give their suggestions when I am in trouble.	I_S0
Without my mother's suggestion, I will not know how important freindship is in my daily life.	E_S0
Furthermore, parents' suggestions can help prevent children from forming bad habits.	S_M1
Once unprobable behaviors become common, it is hard for people to get rid of them.	B_S0
If children are not aware of the mistakes, they tend to lose opportunities to succeed in their future career.	I_S0
For instance, my brother is selfish.	I_S0
He always blames other without reflecting himself.	I_S0
My father wants him to change his mind.	I_S0
However, obviously, my brother doesn't realise his mistakes and he doens't do well in his job.	E_S0
So giving ad	S_S2
 
Nowadays, more and more people are  willing to help the peoples, however, l don not agree that people are more likely to help the stranger which are struggling in trobles	O
Firstly, it is true that human is more willing to care about themselves than others.	S_M0
They may have the mind that others problem are not caused by them so they have  no duty to help them whatever these people very need help, it will happen more likely if both their relavents and strangers they meet needs help, so, although the strangers may have more need help, people will  more possible to give their relavents a hand because they have more connect and more intimacy.	B_S1
That is why people are lass willing to choose strangers especially in that situation.	E_S1
In addition, people want to be paid back if thet contribute a lot to help others.	S_M0
Strangers means it is more impossible to get pay back because the strangers know nothing about you, so they may thought it is easy for you to help them, also strangers means the connetion of them is more difficult, people may hard to ask for reward because they may feel embarrased to ask things to a stranger.	S_S2
Besides, people fear that the strangers are liar.	S_M0
More and more people are  framed by helping strangers, they perform that they relly need help, like unability people beg beside the road, but in fact, they may not have any disease, they just use this way to earn the money, so this situations happens many times that makes many people not trust the strangers, thus they are not willing to help the strangers.	B_S1
On balance, the events that showed the strangers lie to people cause more people ignore the ask for help form the strangers.	E_S1
To sum up, people now still have the less willing of helping strangers which are strugging in trouble, because the strangers may liar to them, may know less about tham, and may distrubute their helping to their relavents.	S_C2
 
Despite the rapid development of today's society, influence from young people is no more than a commonplace.	B_I0
Recently, an interesting question has aroused heated discussion: Do young prople influence the duture of society as a whole?	I_I0
Different people have differential ideas.	E_I0
Some people thinks the youth today still have a great influence to the society as a whole.	B_T0
From my perspective, I think the youth have no influence on the important decisions in society as a whole.	I_T0
My reasons are as follows.	E_T0
First, young people today are obsessed with entertainment so they do not want to influence the decisions in their society.	S_M1
With the high development of Internet, the computer games and applications of short video are more attractive.	B_S0
Young people who are inmature mentally are likey to play computer games, watch the videos and surf on the Internet for a whole day.	I_S0
Due to being addicted with entertainment in electric devices, adolescents are not willing to study knowledge and paticipate with other young people in some activities to influence the society.	E_S0
On top of that, nowadays young people are not prone to communicate and cooperate with others because of the change of interpersonal relationship.	S_M1
With advanced devices like computers, young people now are like to and are able to solve peoblems alone.	B_S0
Being reluctant to cooperate with others, they cannot affect the important decision of society as a whole.	I_S0
On the contrary, in the past, young people have to cooperate to solve the problems in society because they knew that the things could not be solved by one person.	I_S0
Consequently, they tried to influence the decisions of the future of society together.	E_S0
Admittedly, some young people are still trying to affeect the decisions that determine the future of siciety.	B_C0
For example, one of my classmates participates in the design of the subway in my city.	I_C0
However, he is the only young person in the team.	I_C0
Young people do not influence the future of the society together.	I_C0
And when consider the two main elements above, the paticipation is only a minor factor.	I_C0
To put it into a nutshell, I agree with the statement that young people today have no influence on the significent decisions of the future of society as a whole.	E_C0
 
Currently, we may find it can be quite normal to find the news or scandel of celebrities through the internet and TV.	B_I0
Some people hold the point that famous entertainers and atheletes are supposed to have more privacy than they have now while other may insist totally different views.	E_I0
According to my point, the celebrities deserve to have more privacy.	S_T1
To begin with, although they may be quite famous and can easily catch the eyes from public, the famous people are still ordinary huamn being who also want to have secret and enjoy the right of pricacy.	S_M1
The famous people can also feel bothered when the reporters fowllow them everywhere and use various equipments to picture every moment.	B_S0
The normal people also cannot bear the same stiuation so there is no reason that the famous people should be bothered like this.	I_S0
Sometimes, the media even cause serious accident because of the violation of privacy.	I_S0
For example, in my country, there is a famous entertainer called Huge, who has been chased by the car drived by a reporter.	I_S0
To avoid the car, he got injured and the car accident made him have to leave the career of being actor for a while.	I_S0
And he writed a letter  in his social websites which represent his willing that in his daily life, he just wanted to enjoy the personal life without exposed to public.	I_S0
Definitly, people in that time awared of the importance of protecting famous people's privacy.	E_S0
Second , it can be quite normal for the media to blow up the things out of propotion since they want to acquire people's attention and make profit.	S_M1
And the tendancy may be more and more serious.	B_S0
However, the varity of rumous may also misleading the public.	I_S0
In the terms of public, protecting famous people's privacy can also decline the fake news spreading among the people.	I_S0
To illustrate, a famous singer called Justin who was reported to inject drug and people believed the news.	I_S0
Finally, it turned out that the singer just have drink with friends in pub and the picture was faked so as to arous people's curosity.	E_S0
In the case, the puli	O
 
I don't think this is a good idea.	S_T0
Firstly,if children have a strong will to have money to buy something,they might cheat on the test in order to get high marks and have money.	B_T1
Children might think that they get money instead of working hard.	I_T1
In that case,giving them money is not good a good way to study hard.	E_T1
Secondly, school-age children are too yong to control their money.	S_M0
They might buy things they don't really need , and in that case it is a waste of money.	B_S0
Children might get the bad habbit using money.	I_S0
Whatsmore,they might do something bad by using it.	I_S0
There are too many new things for children,maybe good and maybe not.	I_S0
Actually they cannot disguise whether they are good or not,however.	I_S0
So they might not be a good person gradually.	I_S0
It might even influence their children's personality.	E_S0
Thirdly, I don't think parents should teach their children in this way.	S_M0
If they really want their children to be better, they should accompany them and help them.	B_S1
This is the responsibility of being parents.	E_S1
One of my classmate is a good example to explain this my statement.	S_M0
His father always said that he would receive a lot of money if he could get a good grade.	B_S0
But actually he didn't want to do anything for his wok,and he cheated the teacher and his parents to get money.	I_S0
Consequently,his teacher found he lied all the time and at last he was dropped out.	E_S0
So I don't think giving children money for a high grade is a good way to stimulate them to work harder.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, people always make mistakes when we are undergoing somethings.	B_T0
Merely can people correct thier mistake in instance.	I_T0
I think we should correct our mistakes in instance when we are making somthing wrong.	I_T0
To testify our mistakes is the most improtant thing, to detect ourselves from making more mistakes.	E_T0
As an internship, we should stop our opinion right away and correct the mistake as soon as possible.	S_M1
I think as a internship, the most significant quality is learning.	B_S0
We should be willing to accept our errors and learn from it.	I_S0
When you're in the meeting, you acclaim your own opinion and you should be responsible for your statement.	I_S0
Take myself for example, my major is Urban Planning.	I_S0
Our professional knowleadge is about landuse, if we have wrong in calculating the use rate of the land.	I_S0
For example, our rugulatory planning in residental is 1.0, but I get the wrong data that the use rate is 1.5; Not only I make mistake, the later goup members in calculating the green use will be changed.	I_S0
If Ifailed to  correct my words, my teammates should revise thier plan to match the wrong data.	I_S0
In this way, I have to stop my statment and correct my error immediatly.	I_S0
This is not the avoidable problem and I should recalculate the data instead.	E_S0
As a student, we aren't mature enough to make professional decisions and always make mistakes.	S_M1
My professor told me that making decisions is not the most improtant thing, unless you disregard it is the unacceptable thing.	B_S0
So I think the significant thing is to stop right away and correct the mistake.	I_S0
Now you're in the classroom, students around you can help you find out the problem's root.	I_S0
It doesnt matter when you make mistakes in the concep theories.	I_S0
You have enough time to revise and regulate the problem.	I_S0
Not only can you learn the new things and can enhance the relationship with your classmates.	I_S0
The most improtant thing is that you can have more ideas about the plan and can be more acceptable to other opinions.	E_S0
In the nutshell, admiting your mistakes are not shameful.	B_C1
It's a greatful action.	E_C1
Everybody makes the wrong, but the successful people are more willing to accept thier inmerit and transfer	O
 
With the unpredentedly rapid advancement of socity,young people could do many things to this society, so they may have some influence to this society, this phenomeon triggers an interesting discussionre regarding whether young people today have no influence on the important decision to the future of socity.	B_T0
As for me, i assert young people have influence to the future of society.	E_T0
nowadays,young people have many achievement on technology, we have read some news about robert or some new technology achievevment, there are many young people take part in some experiment,they use their learns to create some thing new, in our daily life we can use this,because these creation we can have a better life.	S_M0
In this part young people have their influence,through this kind of achievement, thsy can have some power,this power may not only in technology this part, they also have some poewr in politic this part, when they have some power in politic this part,they give some speech,this speech or creation may have some influence to the whole society.	S_S2
The second, today,we have a lot of superstar, most of super stars re young people, for example if a superstar took part in a programm on TV ,many people will watch it and imitate some action and some time it will change their cognitive .	S_M0
This is just a little part, for a long time some people imtate their clothing, their action, almost some way of their solution.	B_S1
A lot of people imiate them and it may have some influence to old people almost a whole society.	E_S1
On the contray ,many people think young people are too young too simple, they don't know the right way.	S_M0
Old people have a lot of influence, so they may have important decision that determine the future of society.	B_S0
However, nowaday we have international society, we shoud develop our society our country to a internation country, so youngpeople may have some     experiment about go to western country have a study, they will take some advantage to our country,for a long time, we will have some influence.	I_S0
That's why i agree young people have influence on the important decison that determine the future of society as a whole.	E_S0
 
When our children are at school, there always comes with a problem,the score.	B_I0
Is the score high or low?	I_I0
How is the rankings in your class?	I_I0
Have you met your parents' expectations?	E_I0
Parents always hope their children can get higher scores.	S_T1
However, their childern care not much about the score itself.	S_M0
It is a common phenomenon that parents reward their children with money in order to stimulate childrens' potential for reaching higher grades.	B_S1
But everything has two sides.	E_S1
On the positive side, that is,will raise childrens' awareness on grades going up and down.	S_M0
Maybe they will work harder on the studies to deal with the test with fewer flaws and higher grades.	B_S0
As the saying goes, No pains,No gains.	I_S0
If you don't study harder, you will not get the money in consequence of not having the high score.	I_S0
Also,giving money forms chilrens' good habits such as diligence and concerntration.	E_S0
On the contrary,the negetive side.	S_M0
The child may be used to the way of receiving.	B_S0
While not everything has the reward.	I_S0
What is more significant,a student should focus on study rather than money.	I_S0
Giving money may mislead the child at a very young age who might think everything is connected with money.	I_S0
While the academic field is more pure than that.	E_S0
Based on the reasons listed above, I reckon that the best way is giving  money from the very beginning to form the childrens' habits, then gradually reduce the amount of money.	S_C2
 
For some people ,they think their child should not beder than other children ,and for the equip which is they think ,they always give their child enough money.	B_T1
However I think that child should know economical ,and the parents doesn't give their children money.	E_T1
Don't give money to children can culture children the meaning of save money.	S_M1
Case many children spend money more in some thing with low price ,these children haven't saveing consciousness.	B_S0
They can't understand their parent's tired of makeing money .	I_S0
For avoid  producting these things,we should culture children's saveing consciousness.	E_S0
Don't offer money to children for culturing their indenpend.	S_M1
As we all know ,Jew usually smart and indenpend.	B_S1
The reason is that Jew never offer money to their children.	E_S1
Jew beleve that children have the ability about minking money ,so they tell their children when they in their childhood is that	O
 
In my opinion, I think this is not a good idea for a school-age children.	S_T0
It will give children a wrong thinking a bout study, even it will effect the future of children.	S_T1
On one hand, there is a problem of this statement, if parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade(mark) they get in school, how much should parents give?	S_M1
if parents give too much money to children, how does chilren spend those money, a children cant contro too much money.	B_S0
if they get lots of money by they grade, and they dont know how to use it safely, they maybe will learn how to smoke, drug or drinking hard.	I_S0
What i want to say is when a children get the money that they cant contro, it will be very dangers.	I_S0
So parents offer money for grade is not a good idea.	I_S0
in the other side, if parents just give a little money to thire children, that cant buy anything, children will not care about this award, cause it too less.	I_S0
If children dont care about the gift they get when they have a good grade, it will be fine, if not , children will be very sad, even hate study and naver get high grade again.	I_S0
So, too much money is dangers and less money will heart children, parents should not give the money to children.	I_S0
they can pick their children the zoo or some place to have fun, its better then just offer money.	E_S0
On the other hand, just offer their children money for each high grade they get in school is not a parents should do.	S_M1
children study and get a high grade is more like make their parents happy.	B_S0
if parents only give money to their children, its not fair to chilren.	I_S0
i think parents should spend more time on their children but money.	I_S0
i think if parents take children to a park, children will be more happy then get money.	I_S0
children need parents' love not money, so i think this statement is not a good idea.	E_S0
All the all, i want to say is that money is not good for children, parents spend more time is better then offer money.	B_C1
So some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is not a good idea.	E_C1
 
I  don't agree with the opinoin that parents should let children make mistakes,but they can let them learn from mistakes.	B_T0
There are several reasons about it.	E_T0
If parents let children make mistakes,there could have some terrible result.	S_M0
Some mistakes that children made had coused many terrible result.	B_S0
They play with the fire,use the electricity without the adult accompany,even climb to the high place.	I_S0
These could harm children in terrible ways,children  suffered from burning,broke their legs from fall down from the high place,get electric shock and become disabled for their rest of their life.	I_S0
That could make their parents very sad.	E_S0
But,there's a useful value for children learn from mistakes.	S_M0
Some children had made some mistakes  at schoollike bulling friends,play tricks on girls,play with the tools from the labotory or from tool box.	B_S0
Their teacher find it,criticized,punished the children and called their parent.	I_S0
They could been warned from their teachers and their parents.	I_S0
They learned from it and never made the same mistakes even a single time.	I_S0
The value of mistake could become the experience to study,make you become serious on study.	E_S0
Children didn't make their mistakes on purpose,they didn't get enough knowledge.	S_M0
Parents sould give them good knowledge to their children.	B_S0
If they make mistakes,cirticize is enough.	I_S0
Don't yell or beat your children,also can say dont punish them in terrible ways.	I_S0
The key to teach your children is to lead them to right way.	I_S0
It's not a good idea to punish them in terrible ways.	I_S0
That could do harm to childrens'heart.	I_S0
What you need is to communicate with their children a lot.	I_S0
That could be a peaceful way to educate your child.	E_S0
In the end,parents need to do something that need to do to provide their children make mistakes as soos as possible.	B_C0
Lead them in correct ways,and communicate with your child.	I_C0
That is the key to educate your child.	E_C0
 
In our daily life, we work or study everyday, sometimes we need to relax.	B_I0
We have different way to relax, but in thses way  that we do not know which is pair to us.	E_I0
In my opinion, I think reading a book will be better for us.	B_T0
Everyone knows that the knowledge is impotant to us in today.	E_T0
But someone told me, he think that watching TV will be better, I tell to him you are not mature.	B_T1
Reading a book will takes you a enomtion relaxing.	E_T1
Fristly, reading book can bring us a emontion relaxing.	S_M0
You know that reading  a book after we calm down that we can get  a lot of knowledge.	B_S0
I remerber that thing, I walk on the streets with frends, it is so hot outside.	I_S0
I try to find so store to buy some water and juice.	I_S0
We find the store finally.	I_S0
But that is not store, it is a library.	I_S0
We in, than we find some book to read with some water and juice.	I_S0
That time I know that reading a booking can relaxing.	E_S0
Secondly, reading book can get some knowledge.	S_M0
If I do exercise, maybe I can learn something at last.	B_S0
But if I read book for relaxing, maybe I will learn some knowledge in the end.	I_S0
I once heard someone said, it is good for you to never stop reading.	E_S0
Thirdly, doing exercise can relaxed, I agree.	S_M0
But I can not use our brain to think wy the people should do this, why the person`s next action.	B_S0
If I read book, I wll consider about the next chapete or feel the character`s feeling.	I_S0
This is the fantastic for reading books.	E_S0
In conclusion, someone think doing physical exercise is better but I do not think.	B_C0
I think we should play for fun.	I_C0

Recently, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether the ability to maintain friendship with small group of people is more important and decides your happiness, compared with the ability to make new friends easily.	S_I0
As far as I  am concerned, the ability to maintain friendship is more important.	S_T0
To begin with, the ability to maintain friendship can consolidate friendship.	S_M1
To be more specific, friendship just like wine.	B_S0
As we all know,  the longer the wine is stored, the better it tastes and so is friendship.	I_S0
The ability to maintain friendship help people consolidate their friendship  and thus they will have more good friends instead of some friends which just know each other.	I_S0
On the contrary, the ability to make new friends easily cannot provide people good friends since people always make firends but they never consolidate their friendship.	I_S0
For example, I always meet and play with a small group of my friends.	I_S0
After a long time we have been spent, we became best friends of each others, and they will always try their best to help me when I was in trouble.	I_S0
It is no doubt that they are good friends.	I_S0
However, my brother Jack always make new friends since it is very easy for him to do that and he never consolidate his friendship.	I_S0
It is ture that he has a lot of friends, but none of them help him when he need money to create his business.	E_S0
To be folllowed, the ability to maintain friendship can give you more happines than just make new friends.	S_M1
To illustarate, people will be more happy when they spend their time with their best friends.	B_S0
Even though they do not prepare for what they do.	I_S0
On the contrary, make new friends always need to prepare but people may not be happy.	I_S0
For instance, people always make friends in some social activity and they always need to prepare their face and soem sotries about them to make sure they have enough attractive to others.	I_S0
It is no doubt that in this case they can make new friends easily but they may not happy since they just force themselves to be a perfect human.	I_S0
However, spending time with a small group of your firends give you happiness even though you just talk with each other and drink some wine.	I_S0
You do not need to prepare and you can open your heart.	I_S0
This is why maintain friendship with a small group of people can give you happiness.	E_S0
In a conclusion, the ability to maintain friendship with a small group of people can not only consolidate friendship but also give people happiness.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, more and more people begin to pay attention on university education.	S_I0
Then, someone suggests that university should spend more money on salaries for professer, because it will improve the quality of edcation.	B_T1
In my poinion, spending money only on salaries for professer is not a good way to improve the quality of education.	E_T1
On the one hand, there are some other ways which can improve the quality better.	S_M1
For example, arranging a tutor for every students from the first semester will be a good selection.	B_S0
Here are some reasons in the following.	I_S0
First, It can help freshman adapt the college life quickly so that they are able to be more attentive to their studies.	I_S0
Second, tutors can help students deal with the majority of problems which freshman can not solve it on their own.	I_S0
I heard a lot of reports that freshman got depressed because they can not find the people who can help them.	I_S0
Last, tutors can play a role in supercising students' hard study and it will help students obtain a good-looking grade.	I_S0
there is no doubt that the three idea above are better than spending money on salaries for professer in order to improve the quality of education.	E_S0
On the other hand,	S_M1
All in all, as I mentioned above, Providing professer with money as their salary has potential hazards such as running out of their motivation to teach.	B_C0
There is no doubt that it will damage to the quality of education.	I_C0
Nevertheless, there are still some other ways can enhance the quality of  education such as arranging a tutor for every freshman.	E_C0
 
Nowadays.	S_S2
It is universially accepted that  parents  should allow their children making mistakes and learning from their errors because it is benefical for children's growth and it provides them an opportunity to learn how to solve problems and take responsibilty during that period.	S_T1
Nevertheless, some people reject this notion and they believe it is too young for children to learn from their mistakes and partents should guide their children.	B_T0
As far as I am concerned, I agree with the first idea and I think children should learn from their mistakes as their own rights.	E_T0
First of all, if parents let children make mistakes and let them learn from it, it will be good for children's mental growth Children learn about responsiblity from that process and they will mind their behaviors in the future by themselves and become more independent compared with others.	S_M1
Professor Lee did a research last year about weather parents should let children learn from their erros, he found that those who learned from their mistakes when they were young became more successful and independent than those who did not.	S_S2
Secondly, parents can not manage their children all the time because they will grow up one day and establish their own family.	S_M1
I think the best way for young children to grow up is to learn from their mistakes at very young age,it is a good way for them to become independent and take responsibity.	B_S0
Take Madame Cruie for example, when she was very young, her parents allowed her to make mistakes because they believed there is no perfect person in the world and let her learn from her mistakes.	I_S0
For these speical experiences, Madam Cruie became more independent and knew how to overcome difficults compared with other girls at her age, finally,she made gaint breakthrough in science research, To sum up, I believe that it is parents' duty to let their children learn from their mistakes.	I_S0
It is fine when you make mistakes, more importantly it is your attitude towards your mistakes.	I_S0
If children sovle problems by themselves without parents' help, they will become more responsible and independant when he meet difficults and mistakes in the future.	E_S0
 
Nowadays, a controversial topic has arouse a heated debate among students: whether we should communicate with classamated in person or just through emails.	B_I0
Opinions vary from person to person.	I_I0
Some hold the view that communicating through emails is much more convenient among students.	E_I0
Contrary to this point is my perspective that it is better for people in college to communicate in person.	B_T0
My point can be elabrated as follows.	E_T0
First, communicating in person is more convenient for people to exchange their opinions and reach an agreement.	S_M1
Different person always has different characterastic, so it is easily for people have different opinions facing same problems.	B_S0
Though the way communicating in person, people can easliy share their ideas.	I_S0
Even there are some disagreement between them, people can also reach an agreement in a short time.	I_S0
Contrary to this, sending emails can not be that convenient for many reasons.:people are always not read the emails at once;sending information in this way sometimes can not show their feelings in a right way.	I_S0
It will take a lot of time but still not solve the problem.	I_S0
For example, my roommate David needs to do a presentation by teamwork.	I_S0
He needs to exchange his ideas to his teammates first and finish the task after them reach an agreement.	I_S0
He sends emails to his teammates but they reply three days later and they has lots of diagreements.	I_S0
The group spend a week to decide what to do and David does not have time to do a good preparation.	E_S0
Second, people can use lots of different kinds of ways during communicating in person to help translate their ideas in a better way.	S_M1
The most difficult things during communicating can be how to let another one knows what is in my mind.	B_S0
When communicating in person, people can use body language or draw some imigines to help tranlate his opinion to his friend, Contrary to this, communicating in emails means people can only show their views by words.	I_S0
And it is do a hard task for people.	I_S0
For example, my friend Tony likes body language.	I_S0
When he communicating with others, he always using body language to help show what is in his mind.	I_S0
In this way, he can easily communicate with others in person.	E_S0
As i have mentioned above, i do think people should communicate in person,And this way will help people live a ea	O
 
Currently,there exists a phenomenon that some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in the school，which arouses the public's concern and discussion.	B_I0
Some individuals hold the view that the kids can be encouraged and inspired to learn hard in this way while others argue that high grades can not be connected with money.	E_I0
From my perspective,I regard it as a unwise way to encourage school-age children by giving money.	S_T1
Initially,each children who learn in the school have the duty to study hard to get good grades.	S_M0
They study hard for themselves but not for their parents or the money they will receive.	B_S0
Having high grades is conducive to their further improvement and their own development in the future.	I_S0
Therefore,they are respected to study spontaneously and ask for no reward.	E_S0
Simultaneously,kids receiving money tend to become thirsty for more money when they get higher grades.	S_M0
Provided that their parents don't offer them adequate money,they will be angry and uncontented with their parents.	B_S0
For instance,my uncle gave his son a little money when he got 95 in a math test,which his son was satisfied with.	I_S0
However,at the next time,he required more money when he got 100 in the test.	I_S0
My uncle didn't agree with his idea,and they had a tough argument and even didn't speak to each other in a long time.	I_S0
The example illustrates the perspective well that the reward doesn't function as well as we think about.	E_S0
Last but not least,being exposed to money-related reward too early is not beneficial to them,for the reason that they may relate everything to money.	S_M0
They may hope that they can get money although they only get a little improvement or do something for others.	B_S1
When you ask them to concentrate on classes and work hard, they don't listen to your opinions and ask for reward instead,which will definitely bring about negative influnce in his later life.	E_S1
To draw the conclusion, I don't endorse offering school-age children money for high grade they get in the school.	S_C2
 
Recently, the problem of whether it is desirable for kids to select jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs or not has caused a considerable concern.	B_I0
Some people claim that choosing jobs that are totally different for parents' jobs contributes to boardening children's horizons.	E_I0
However, I hold the opposite view that it is advisable for kids to select jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs for following reasons.	S_T1
The first reason to support my standpoint is that choosing jobs that are similar to parents' jobs paves the way for getting promoted in the future.	S_M0
To be sepcific, when children iniates their jobs, their parents who are fully experienced are able to teach their children with several professional knoledge and useful skills, which enables their children to become more outstanding in the enterprises.	B_S0
For example, my father used to be a manager in the international company.	I_S0
He charged the marketing department and accumulated a large amount of experiences.	I_S0
Afterwards, I selceted the similar jobs and wanted to become better.	I_S0
Then, my father taught me a considerable of knowledge and information, it leds me to adapt the working atmosphere quickly and did a decent job.	I_S0
At last, because of my outstanding job, I was promoted to the manager.	I_S0
Therefore, only in this way can people to get promoted in an efficient way.	E_S0
Secondly, selecting jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs lays a solid foundation for saving a great deal of time.	S_M0
precisely, since children encouter various problem, they tend to ask help from their parents, which can solve the working problem efficiently and save time.	B_S0
For instance, my uncle is one of managers in the company.	I_S0
Once, he meeted some proble m that his worker had a tendency to work in an low efficiency.	I_S0
He considered thsi problem for a long period of time, and could solve it.	I_S0
Afterwards, he obtained helps from his father.	I_S0
Then, he applied  methods into his employees and it did worked.	I_S0
At last, he could have more time to allow hsi staff to finish other works.	I_S0
Therefore, it is choosing similar jobs that is beneficial for children to improve their efficiency and save time.	E_S0
Admittedly, there are some advantages of choosing jobs that are similar to their parents' jobs.	S_M0
To be more detailed, because children work in a different area, they tends to boraden their perspective.	B_S1
However, it is not suitable for a long term growth of career.	E_S1
To sum up, I believe that it is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents'	S_C2
 
In light of the rapid development of the city,the pollution of the environment and the heavy traffic have been cared about more and more by the pubic,for which the country needs to develop its public transportation.	S_I0
The blke sharing scheme came into being in this situation.	S_T1
The appearance of the bike sharing scheme does bring convinience to Wuhan people'S life.	S_M1
When the destination is not so far,it's easier to ride the shareing bike rather than take buses or subway or just walk on foot.	B_S0
What's more,it's a good service for users to experience at a low prince.	I_S0
People don't need to buy a blke by thenselves.	I_S0
Riding for one time just costs about one yuan.	E_S0
However, there are also many problems need to be solved now.	S_M1
First,we can see that the firms of sharing bike like Mobike and ofo can't make profits now even three years after their establishment.	B_S0
Depending on other firms to give money for their development is absolutely an undependable way,and if this industry can work conitnuous waits to be seen.	I_S0
Second,the impolite behaviours are always seen when riading the sharing bike,such as breaking the bikes,using them as their own ones and change the 2D code to get money illegally.	I_S0
Third,the government hasn't constructed enough riding and parkig places for bike,and because of the boom of the number of bikes,it's hard to control this just by several volunteers.	E_S0
 
Nowadays, parents award their school-aged children money for each high mark they get in school.	B_I0
This phenomenon has raised great controversy over whether it's a right way to educate inmature children.	E_I0
In my view, I give this act full support based on the following reasons.	S_T0
First, this way can encourage children to study hard and keep them on the right track since they are too young to understand what is really important for them.	S_M0
According to a recent scientific research,it is not until graduation from high school that most of the children get to know that education actually benefits themselves a lot.	S_S2
Second, it grants parents some precious free time for relaxion.	S_M0
Imagine one have to teach thier children how to solve the math problems in his child's homeworks after a working day.	B_S0
How tiring can it be!	I_S0
Therefore, by awarding children money for high grades, children themselves have to spend more time on studying with less help from their parents.	E_S0
Third, this method will teach children children an important idea that will benefits them for the rest of their lifes.	S_M0
And that is hard works will pay off.	B_S0
Through giving children awards when they achieve a great score, children get to know the importance of hard work.	I_S0
In addition, the sooner we use this method, the more deeply this idea will rooted in children' minds.	I_S0
Thus, if they meet some tough situations the future, they will pay more efforts to conquer them by themselves instead of waiting for their parents for assistance.	E_S0
Last but not least, although this way might not be perfect, it is significantly helpful.	S_M0
According to my own experience, I used to struggle with my grade in the middle school.	B_S0
However, after my father introduce this method to me, my grades improved a lot because back then I was a fan of shoes.	I_S0
Therefore, in order to buy the shoe I've been dreaming of, I have to put in lots of efforts in study.	I_S0
And my efforts paid off.	E_S0
In a nut shell, this is a brilliant idea because it can benefit both the children and the parents.	B_C1
So why not just give it a shot?	E_C1
 
Whether to offer school-age children money for hogh mark is a debatable problem.	S_I0
In my opinion it is absolutly a great idea to offer money for their high grade.	S_T0
Offering money can give children encouragements to work harder.	B_T1
When children get paid, they will learn that if they work hard and get grades, their payments can be repaid.	E_T1
My cousin used to have no interest in study, but when my aunt permitted to offer her extra money,she began to spare no effort to study.	B_S0
Finally my cousin het more and more progress ,and became more and more interested in studying.	I_S0
Recently ,in an English test, she got top five in her class.	I_S0
If she could not get extra money form parents, maybe she will not be so ambitious in getting progress.	E_S0
Offering money for high mark can teach children a principle that no pains , no gains.	S_M1
Students can not ger good grades without  hard work.	B_S0
For example ,my brother , in order to make little progress, stay up very late and get up very early to learn history.	I_S0
Every time he wants to give up , the prize reminds him that he will not achieve anything if he choose to quit.	E_S0
At last my brother persisted for six months preparing his final exam.	S_M1
And the result is convincing he reached his goal and also  got his money for his payment.	B_S0
Giving money for students' good grades can make students more adaptable to the society.	I_S0
As compitition becomes more and more intense , students must become more and more  competitive.	I_S0
No one will pay you money if you make the work a mess or you have no impact on making profit.	I_S0
Only when you make distirbution in your field, you can get your payback.	I_S0
My calssmate started to receive moner for good grades at a very young age .	I_S0
Now when he works in a shop he always  wants to do more work than his colleages , because he knows all his effort will be payed back.	I_S0
And he becomes the most effective staff in the shop.	E_S0
So ,from three perspectives ,i firmly believe giving children money for their good mark is benificial to school-age children.	S_C2
 
Nowadays,some company always give wokers thesame work.	S_I0
In my opinion,this is harmful for their satisfication.	B_T0
I think do different tasks could help develoop suffs'satisfication for the following reasons.	E_T0
The first reason is that this could help let them not get bored.	S_T1
If they always face the same work.	B_S0
Although they will become more and more great on doing this.	I_S0
When th time past,They will soon get bored with it.	I_S0
And when they are bored,the efficient will also become lower and lower.	I_S0
This is bad for their satisfication.	I_S0
But if you do different types of works,you will never get bored,because you are always faceing new chanllenges.	E_S0
The second reason is that have different tasks everyday is a way to keep the wokers have new achievement every day.	S_M1
Every time when they solve a new targe,they will become full of achievement.	B_S0
This kind of feeling could make them become more proud of thier woke.	I_S0
And consider they are the main part of the company.	I_S0
That couldmak themmore active to develop their confidence to satisfy them.	E_S0
The third reason is that this make them able to always have new things coud tell others.	S_M1
Every time when they talk with others with woke.	B_S0
They always have new things and storys could been said.	I_S0
in fact,every time when they talk with the company's daily story,is a kind of way to develop their believe to the company.	I_S0
When they start talk to company more and more,it obviously shows that they love the company and satisfy with their work.	I_S0
That's good for develop a group of stuff who always believe in the leader of the company and work hard to solve new tasks.	I_S0
After ther finish the tasks,they would also talk to others with it.	I_S0
And it will develop their satisfication again.	I_S0
Make it as a cycle.	E_S0
conclude to those reasons,I believe that give different types of tasks to the workers is a good way to make them become more satisfied on their work.	S_C2
 
Personally, I agree with that it's of greater importance for government to spend money to improve Internet access than to improve public transportation.	B_I0
And my reasons are as follows.	I_I0
First and foremost, the access to Internet is the key to a new world.	I_I0
It can take you farther than public transportation can do.	I_I0
It is universally acknowledged that the 21st century is the century of information, and Internet is the key to those numerous information.	I_I0
With the access to Internet, one can travel all over the world simply with a small screen and even the universe.	I_I0
What's more, the Internet can answer his questions and help him accumulate knowledge in addition to cultivate his curiosity.	E_I0
According to a recent data from the government, nearly half of the citizens in my homeland still haven't got  access to Internet so far.	S_M1
Most of them live in remote places far from the prosperous cities.	B_S0
If they could get access to the Internet, they could be linked to the larger world outside their small villages in a virtual way.	I_S0
Moreover, the access could equip them with so many resources that they can learn a lot from them and live a more colorful life, even coming up with some fantastic ideas that benefits the society.	E_S0
Second,improving Internet access costs less than improving public transportation in addition to brings more benefits.	S_M1
As mentioned above, half of the population lives in remote places.	B_S0
It costs more time and money to bring them public transportation .	I_S0
In comparison, improving Internet access is easier to reach and will be more benificial in a short term.	I_S0
Therefore, the government should focus more on Internet access  improvement and put the pt in the second place.	E_S0
As what is mentioned above, it's more important for the government to spend money on Internet access improvement than improving public transportation.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, the education is a really essential issue for debates.	S_I0
One thinks that parents should warn their children and keep children away from the wrong things, another thinks that children should be allowed to make mistake and learn from their own mistakes.	S_T1
From my perspective, the latter one is better for children to learn and grow.	S_T0
Firstly, making mistake and learning from it will be more expressional for children.	S_M1
Children usually do not know whether is right or worong about what they do.	B_S0
Thus, if their parents tell them about the thing and alarm them do not the worng thing.	I_S0
indeed, they will keep away from the so-called wrong thing.	I_S0
However, they cannot understand some bad severe consequence and learn some essenticial experience from the mistakes.	I_S0
Whereas children have the opportunity to make mistakes, they undoubtly have more importance understanding and new experience from doing so.	E_S0
Secondly, keeping mistakes away from children will lose their courage to face mistake.	S_M1
A  large number of children keep away from mistakes or some wrong things is due to their parents's words.	B_S0
However, children inherently have tendency to do various interesting things whether the result of doing these is good or bad.	I_S0
It is harmful for children to explore and learn from doing the different things if restricting what them can do.	I_S0
Restricted what they can do, children will lose interest to explore new experience and courage to face the wrong result they did.	E_S0
To conclude, children should have the opportunity to make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.	B_C1
In this way, children will experience more new things and keep the courage to face mistakes, and flinally grow to a good audlt.	E_C1
 
Do you enjoy talking with your big family members?	B_I0
And do you like your uncle or your aunts?	I_I0
I think a family have a lot of family mambers that this family will get more well-being.	I_I0
Because they can bring us a lot of help just like give us some advice or help us take care of our parents.	I_I0
So for these statements that the extended family is less important than it was in the past.	E_I0
I do not agree with.	S_T0
First, sometime the extended family could provide some useful advice to you.	S_M2
In the most situation, the young people do not want to listen to their parents or their closest people.	B_S0
This is because, we have the challenge thinking and most of the time the advices from their parents are right.	I_S0
However, if the advice provide by our extended family members, we will think it more carefully because we care about the thinking from the people around us.	I_S0
One time I play very late at night, when my parents argue me I feeled very angry and do not want to listen more.	I_S0
But my uncle talk with me after several days and told me get home late is not a good habit.	I_S0
I feel very shy and I think I leave a bad impression to my uncle.	I_S0
In order to leave a good impression to my uncle I never get home late.	I_S0
So the advice of the extended family are very improtant.	E_S0
Second, when we grow up we will go out to study in the university.	B_C0
Just like me I will go to a abroad university and my parents only have one son that is me.	I_C0
The time go out to study is too long and I can not go home for even several years.	I_C0
If I have a lot of extend family they could help me take care of my parents.	E_C0
 
I think it is a good idea.	S_T1
When the children get good grades.	B_S0
It is a good way to cheer him or her imporve himself or herself.	I_S0
It will makes children do better next time.	I_S0
By the other wise, if the money more than a number that the children should not afford it, it will get worse.	E_S0
 
Generolly speaking, it's a good idea to offer their school-aged children money for the grade their gain in the test of school.	S_I0
For one thing, not every student can have enough motivation to keep on their study.	S_T1
They need something to encourage them to spend more time on getting knowledge from the school.	S_T0
The money provided by their parents can be used as scholarship to encourage them to study more.	B_S0
They are more likely to keep on studying hard when they get scholarship when they have gotten a good grade in school or lose it when they don't study well.	I_S0
For another thing, this measure can tell the children a lesson that the money is gain from their work.	I_S0
There is not something that you can gain without pain.	I_S0
The things you get should be earned by your hard work, even it is offered by your parents.	I_S0
This massure can leave the students an idea that they should work hard in their life to earn more thing and they should not just think about getting it from they parents or other ways for free.	E_S0
At the same time, this method still remains somr problems.	S_M2
It may tell the student that the grade they get in the finally exam is much important than their daily work.	B_S0
They may study hard just when the tests coming rather than keep on trying in their daily lives.	I_S0
Even most, their may use some unfair meanings in order to gain a better grade in the exam.	I_S0
But it's the fact that your daily work is much important than the work just before the tests.	E_S0
Everything has two parts.	B_C0
But compared to its disadvantages, the method that offer the school-age children money for each high grade they get in school has more advantages.	I_C0
In a word, thid mrthod is great.	E_C0
 
I agree with this statement.	S_T0
On the one hand,struggling people can be better accepted by the company,and struggling people are easier to make friends because they can get other's aprove and admire.	S_M1
On the other hand,all people want to be a struggling man and want to make their bestto do many things,but most of us are not able to use our best.	B_S1
so when we notice someone is the man we want,and doing the thing we can't insist,we might admire him ,want to learn from him and try to help him.	E_S1
And why people are more willing to help thr strangers?	S_M1
Recent ages,we are more likely to pay our attetions to protect ourself,so when we are happening to talk with the stragers,our mind are always warning.	B_S1
Nowadays,we can take more our concerns to the strangers,willing to spend time to help others,especialy struggling one.	E_S1
The society at this age,people are tend to help struggling strangers more and more,because that's the kind of person who   others like.	S_C2
 
As far as I'm concerned,it's not a good idea for parents to give their children money when they get high grades.	S_T1
Although it's a simple and effective way for parents to stimulate their kids to study to some extents,its side effect should never be neglected.	S_S2
First of all,the initial goal of study is to broaden one's horizon and improve one's  skill.	S_M2
Offering children money will give them a misunderstanding that they are study for money and their parents rather for thenselves .	B_S0
Moreover,as this mean can inspire a kid to get good grades in a short period,it will never be a long-term measure.	I_S0
After getting their prize for some times,students may simply regard it as a game then get bored of this and neglect the substantial significance of study itself.	I_S0
Sooner or later,they will lose their interest in study thus never be keen on it again.	I_S0
Last but not least,growing in this atmosphere kids will turn into a utilitarian person after they get into society ultimately.	I_S0
Incorrect view about money will make them blindlolded to the real world and eventually become their stumbling block.	I_S0
When facing with the twists and turns in interpersonal interreaction,they will find themsleves too weak to overcome those chanllenges.	E_S0
In a word,not only will this way ruin his future.	S_C2
 
I disagree with that group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel.	S_I0
In my opinion, the best way is traveling by ourselves, because we can control our own time and travel flexibly.	S_T0
Firstly, if we travel by a tour guide, we can't contral our own time.	S_M2
The tour guide usually has a schedule that don't give us enough time to enjoy the travelng.	B_S0
I have the similar experience: in a summer vacation, my mother and I joined a group to travel Shanxi.	I_S0
However, we can't feel happy, because the tour guide don't give us enough time to enjoy every attraction and always take us to the place that sell any good to us.	I_S0
We both think this traveling is bad.	E_S0
Secondly, if we	S_S2
 
I am not agree.	S_T0
To argue my opinion, here comes a story.	S_T1
There's a little boy who calls Meadhaes, he was born in a wealthy family, and he seemed was gifted in learning new things since he was very young.	B_S0
"A clever lucky boy", everyone would say so.	I_S0
But infact,Mead was a humble and hardworking student,he liked knowledge naturally.	E_S0
Everything changed since his father offered money to stimulate Mead to get better grades.	S_M2
The money do become one of encouragements to for Mead at the very first time.	B_S0
He was gradully conscious of that using money can do many things he liked.	I_S0
He loved money better than study.	I_S0
So,once his father forgot to praise him with money, he would became very unhapppy,he would belame it as the most unfair thing in the world!	I_S0
Then, he would take being indolence as revenge.	I_S0
Even he father gaves him more money, he wouldn‘t study harder anymore.	I_S0
At last,he becomes a lazybone.	E_S0
From the story, we can find that, to cultivate one's stud’	O
 
Recently, an interesting discussion has aroused among public: whether students are supposed to be provided more time to do what they want to do.	B_T1
Some people claim that children should spend more time on doing homework or joining in activities that are held in school.	E_T1
However, I think young students should spend more time on whatever they want.	S_T0
My reasons and examples are shown below.	S_T1
Primarily, successful people cultivate their hobbies when they were children.	S_M0
Normally, children's hobbies are not related to staff in school so they have little time to discover or develop their hobbies because they have to go to compus activities after school.	B_S0
And if children can spend more time on their hobbies they are usually open-minded and have specialists which gives them more options to choose when they grow up.	I_S0
For example, my little brother likes playing computer games and he begins to interested in making games so he learns programming online and now he is a very successful programmer in Tencent even if he is poor in sports.	E_S0
Additionally, children who spend time on what they want to do have a good studying condition.	S_M0
This is because they daily lives are full of what they likes and they have the chance to stay with them which makes them satisfied and cheerful.	B_S0
Therefore, they have a relaxing condition and they can pay full attention to class.	I_S0
For instance, when I was a child,I like watching movies and I usually spend 2 hours a day on watching time and I feel my daily lives are relaxing and abuntant so I can be relaxed to take classes.	E_S0
Granted, children spend most of their time on school activities or sports can may have wonderful school life.	S_M0
However, those young students usually do not have many spical skills and are really common.	B_S1
Because they all experience same activities and do the same thing together all the time.	E_S1
In conclusion, children are supposed to be given more time to do whatever they want which can make them successful in the future and also let them have a good studying condition in class to get a good grade.	S_C2
 
As we know, parents are the best and the most significant teachers to children.	B_I0
In children's childhood ,they are likely to be innocent and not sophisticated enough to do everything advisable and suitable.	I_I0
What should parents do when their chilren are facing challenge or fall into a dilemma?	I_I0
Is it a wise manner to command or help your children ?	E_I0
In my point of view,I fairly agree with the statement that parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.	S_T0
For the first reason,if children deal with the problem all by themselves,they will be more independent.	S_M1
Many parents spoil their children and do every things for them,which lead to their children incapable.	B_S0
And in the long run,children will always rely on their parents.	I_S0
It is obvious that the children lose the opportunity to percept the magnificent world.	E_S0
For the second reason,during this process,children may  gather better methods rather than parents' regular ways.	S_M1
On the one hand, if they successfully over come the difficults,something impressive must remain in their minds.	B_S0
And that is the treasure parents can not provide to them.	I_S0
On the other hand, if they fail in the problem,their introspection from the mistake will company them for the whole life.	I_S0
When the next time they face the same problem, they are surely wise enough to avoid the same result.	E_S0
For the last reason, always following parents' step,children may not be creative and imaginativ	O
 
Today, societies and every conutry want to develop well in the future, but if we want to make these achievements, we should rely on our civilians.	S_T0
This is because they can bing us inspirations and they have enough energy to help us develop and they have powerful ability to adapt all kind of environments.	B_T1
Among these civilians, I think young people satisfy all these requirements.	E_T1
Thus, in my opinion, I think young people play an important role in our development of society.	S_T0
First, compared with these old people, young people have more energy to devote themselves in the field.	S_M1
Because nowdays, most profession needs to suffer large stresses, if we do not have health body, we cannnot endure this situation, of course, we cannot create good achievement.	B_S0
For example, now, every country pay more attention on the development of technology such as programmering.	I_S0
As we all know, programmering need to work a long time in order to modify a bug or design a new software, and these tasks need them to pay a lot of energy on it.	I_S0
In order to finish these tasks, they have got to cut off the time used for eating or sleeping.	I_S0
If old people work like this, they easily have sick and the progress of work have got to stop.	I_S0
If your working content is crutial for the company, the results will be terrrible.	I_S0
Instead, if yong peole do this job, they can endure this high pressure and keep working efficiency.	E_S0
Second, young people can actively think, they are more creative than other layer of people.	S_M1
When people become old, their mind will become stabile, it is hard for them to creat something.	B_S0
But today, the world needs creavity.	I_S0
If a country want to develop, they must creat something that another country dose not have.	I_S0
It is impossible for old people.	I_S0
But young peole, they are curious about everything happend arround them.	I_S0
When they see somethig in their daily life, they can through it to think about another things.	I_S0
Then, everything in their life can bring them inspiration to create.	I_S0
But adults, they get used to evetything that happend in thier life, they will not have passion to imagine, most of them choose to adapt the society instead of changing them.	E_S0
Finally, yong people have ability to adapt a new enviroment.	B_C0
It will mean they have this condition to travel or study at different place.	I_C0
Therefore, they have more opportunity to enlarge their scope of knowledge.	I_C0
For example, they can travel around the world, in the process, they will meet all kinds of peole and experience different culture.	I_C0
Thus, they will have new conginition about the foreign countries and their own country.	E_C0
In addition, they will become more independent and their social ability will improve	O
 
Nowadays,more and more parents spent more time on their children's study and it is well acknowledged that chinese parents are willing to use any methods to improve their chindren's academic complements.	B_I0
Among these methods,offering children money for each high grade they get in school is the most well-known and the most controversial one.	I_I0
Many say that giving children money for their grades can boost their interest for study.	I_I0
Others argue that doing this can only led to negative effects.	E_I0
For my part,I prefer to the latter oppinion.	S_T1
Took myself for example,when I was in my primary school,my grades was neither the best one in the class nor the bottom among my peers.	S_M2
However,to get a grade is one thing,to improve my grade is another.	B_S0
I could barely take a step forward in my academic complement for a long period of time.	I_S0
Noticing the situation,my father proposed a schedule.	I_S0
In this schedule,I was strongly encouraged to get a promote in ranks.	I_S0
In spesific,if I could rank one step higher,I would recieve a special "scholarship" from my family for the amount of about 10 yuan.	I_S0
This arangement inspired me the moment I was informed.	I_S0
For the task was not that hard and the rewards were so attractive.	I_S0
However,after a short time of delighting,I got tired about it swiftly.	I_S0
I was no longer willing to fight for a few coins and the schdule failed in the end.	E_S0
From this example from me,we can see that the suduce of money cannot take one's heart forever.	B_C0
For it is shallow and easy to past away.	I_C0
By giving school-age children money for their promotion in schoolworks,parrents might think that they have fullfilled their duty to guide their children.	I_C0
Just in the contrast,acting in this way can only  produce negative effect on thier kin just like the false over-purchasing for money.	I_C0
More importantly,money cannot really draw chidren's interst to their study which is the cornerstone that any successful educator can not mistaken.	E_C0
 
Recently, an interesting topic has aroused a heated debate among public: whether young people today are more willing to invest their time and efforts in improving the world than people do in the past.	S_T1
The answer varies from person to person.	B_T0
From my perspective, I believe young people today indeed are more likely to dedicate their time and energy on progressing this world.	E_T0
To the begin with, young people know more about this world which need to be improved than before.	S_M1
As we know, along withe the ever-lasting development of technology and media, young people have more access to learn what the world looks like, such as by looking through the Weibo and news reports on the TV.	B_S0
After knowing that there are countless people in the world still need money and help, it is possible for young people who have much passion and enthusasim to invest their time and efforts to make the world better.	I_S0
On the contrary, the young people in the past did not have such convinient techonoly to know the world.	I_S0
Even  if they are passionate they have no access to learn what they should do.	I_S0
For example, my friend looked through the news accidentially on the TV about the children in the Africa have no money to get education.	I_S0
She was shocked and decided to help them as a volunteer.	I_S0
Next year , she participated in a project which aim to help children in Africa.	E_S0
Furthermore, young people today are more responsible to improve the world than the one in the past.	S_M1
This is because nowadays people focus on the elite education grandually, which means teenagers are taught that they should do something to the world in order to prove their value.	B_S0
In this case, these young people tend to invest their time and efforts to change the world.	I_S0
In the contrast, in the past, young people aim to make more money and improve their own life quality owing to the deficient food resource.	I_S0
For example, when I was in the primary school, my teacher always told me that we should became a person who can be useful to the society.	I_S0
Later, once I saw someone in the street who need help, such as lost their way I would gave my hand to them and though I was improvinng the world in my way.	E_S0
To sum up, young people today are more likely to improve the world by investing time and efforts than people in the past owing to the tech and education.	S_C2
 
Although doing similar tasks all day long may make workers be professional and form affection towards a certain thing, in my opinion, workers are more satisfied when they have many different types of tasks to do during workday.	S_T1
First, if then change their tasks, they may change their mindset of conducting things.	S_M0
In this way, they can be more concentrate on the work the are doing and also improve their productivity, instead of being distracted.	B_S0
For instant, it is impossible for us to just study math the whole day, for it is really hard and boring.	I_S0
However, if we study math for a while, and then turn to English, it's obvious that we can improve our productivity.	E_S0
Second, changing tasks means that we have the chance to learn to new things.	S_M0
It's really a fantastic challenge for our life.	B_S0
When touching something new and going beyond ourselves, we can achieve a sense of fufillment.	I_S0
Different kinds of skills can also help us be more competitive in our futher life.	I_S0
We can be suitbale to different jods and won't be limited to the certain thing.	E_S0
Nevertheless, if workers do similar tasks alll day long, they may be easy to get bored and can't guarantee the quality of their work.	S_M0
What's worse, because they spend all their time doing the same thing, the may lose the ability in other aspects gradually, which may form a limination to the workers' further development.	B_S1
And his mind will be confined in a small circle, which is really harmful.	E_S1
In summary, although focusing on one thing has many benifits, it is not a good choice for the worker in the long-term.	B_C1
The society is changing all the time, so it's important for workers to learn new things and improve themselves continually to adjust to the changing world.	E_C1
 
Doing physical exercise is undoubtedly the better choice to relax myslef.	S_I0
Though I enjoy reading and watching a movie as well,I do suggest not to take them as the first choice of relaxing.	S_T1
According to the scientific research,doing physical exercise has the magical effect which could make people happy and energetic.	S_M1
A common misunderstanding is that doing physical exercise should make myself tired and worse.	B_S0
Actually,not all the physical exercises are intensive,there's also some gentle one like yoga.	I_S0
As an office worker or a student,you have to endeavour to the whole day sitting which may do harm to your pysical health.	I_S0
Only doing physical exercise can help you to abjust the problem.	I_S0
If you cantinue to sitting in front of the TV or computer reading or watching,the hurt to your health may worse.	E_S0
Some people insist that watching a  a movie or reading a book is more important to refresh their mental world after being over exposed to the horrible facts and overwhelming works.	S_M1
In my opinion,this kind of problem may even worse after being treated by the mental food.	B_S1
They will remind you once again that how tough the truth is if you reach to the non-fiction,while you may feel more despair if you egear the fiction world too much.	E_S1
In comparsion,doing physical exercise will never bring you the problem.	B_C0
When you are running,cycling and sweeting,you will easily forget the past and simply look forward.	I_C0
That is because the sport may give you another target that easier for you to reach.	E_C0

With the develop of the technology, whether the technology is good for children or not is debatable.	B_I0
Some people think that techology has made children less crearive than the past because technology make children just stare at the screen and think nothing at all.	I_I0
While other people argue that the technology displat a wider world to the children which can inspire children's imaginatition.	E_I0
However, I strongly believe that technology has certainly made chidren more creative, here are thr reasons.	S_T1
First of all, like most supporter think, it show children a more colorful world.	S_M0
In the past, because of the lack of the advanced equipment, all one child can see and think is just a small world around her.	B_S0
But now is totally different, we can appreciare the intriguing word whenever we like.	I_S0
Like we can enjoy world's seven wonders just through our computers; we can know the extreme places of the world which we can't even imagine......	I_S0
Can this happen in the past?	I_S0
The answer is certainly "no‘’！	E_S0
Secondly, the technology itself is the result of creative ideas, and it is just a palace of new and interesting ideas.	S_M0
It show us how those celebrated reagard the world, what is their respectives toward on thing.	B_S0
Maybe others' opinion can inspire us and certainly make the children more creative.	I_S0
For example, once, my sister was worried about her painting assignment.	I_S0
My mother suggested her to look through the Internet, and my sister did so, Then, luckily and magically, she found a perfect way to solve her problem and was praised by her teacher.	I_S0
She can solve her problem with the help of the Internet, the new thchnology help her to get new ideaas!	I_S0
Can you still say that technology has made children less creative now?	E_S0
However, we must admit that games on technology might get children list in it.	S_M0
But, games can also theach children the importanve of teamwork and might inspire then in some ways.	S_S2
IN conlusion, technology can make children more creative than the past!	S_C2
 
As far as I am concerned, the practice of giving money to chidren who achieve high grades as a reward has a positive effect on the growth of chidren.	B_T0
Reasons are as follows.	E_T0
First of all, money acts as an encouragement to chidren when they perform well in tests.	S_M0
When educating chidren, especially those who are at such a young age that they are not likey to be interested in the boring studying, the reward means a recognition of all the efforts they make.	B_S0
Chidren tend to work harder to get the rewards and prase, which makes it easier to form a good habit of learning.	I_S0
My young brother is naughty and used to be bored with studying, but nowadayshe always get high grades in every test because he can win a toy he want and get the chance to play games if he succeed to be top3 in the exam.	E_S0
What's more, with money in hand,chidren are required to learn to do their own finacial management.	S_M0
They can make choice s between spending money right now or saving for future use.	B_S0
During the practice of using money,chidren keep thinking about the why and how they will use their money,whcih is beneficial to their future life when they grow up as an independent individual.	I_S0
Take my roommate Luo for example.	I_S0
Luo is a clever people because he makes some investments in stock market in free time and earns some money.	I_S0
He was asked to spend his money on his own at a young age so he knows the importance of management and never waste his money nowadays.	E_S0
I have to admit that using money as rewards do has some drawbacks.	S_M0
Chidren who do not have a strong mind may use money for too much toys or pay too much attention to money rather than knowledge.	B_S1
But with the in-time and correct guidance of parents,these circumstances can be avioded effectively.	E_S1
To summrize,using money as the reward to chidren who get high grades in the exams is adoptive because it encourage them to do better in exams and learn how to use money in right ways.	S_C2
 
It is universally true that celebrities of modern entertainment industies received popularity without effort that even their opinions and statements often followed by people with limited consideration.	S_I0
To be specific, their influence on people shows more connection with the issue of age.	B_T1
Their ideas and concepts are more welcomed by the younger generations rather than the old generation.	E_T1
Firstly, the young people are in the midth of the pursue of their life goals, thus they are more eager to find sussess icons that can encourage them to face challenges in life.	S_M2
The wealth and fame celebreties hold often pose a great attaction to them that with countless cases in life we can see young people following the fashion or lifestyle entertainers shows to cameras in order to become popular in the eyes of thier peers.	B_S0
Though group imitating the speechs and outsfits of their idols, young people dream to develope certain kind of connection to the sucess, and thus formed the cultu Secondly, the old people are less active or productive in the realm of social communication.	I_S0
therefore they have less chance to reveive the first-hand information of what the celebrities had made in the other day.	I_S0
Bedsides, though their rich experience in life, they have already understood the tends and game mechanism in the business world.	I_S0
Therefore, they generally will not take others opinions or statement true scince they have seen enough lies and plots in  their own life.	I_S0
Old generation would believe things after examination, thus they are more likely to be doubters rather than receipients.	E_S0
 
Nowadays most of the youngsters are accessble to get the full iformation of some celebrities with the help of social apps in their cellphones and it has become the essential part of their daily life to keep an eye of their comments or opinions on some issues.	B_I0
Upon this phenomenon, a statement occurs that the opinions of some well-known stars are much more significant to the youngsters compared to that are to the senior citizens.	E_I0
Personally, I give my vote to this view and will explain for this in the following article.	S_T0
To begin with, Surfing on the Internet , for example looking at the friends circle or the microblog, has become a daily issue for the younger generation, which  gradually offer the chances for them to have common topics and even share views with their favorite celebrities.	S_M2
While this is different among the senior citizens for most of them do not spend much time on the cellphone.	B_S0
Furthermore, Most senior citizens sre full of sociasl experiences and they have alreadyt developed their  own social views and values towards the world.	I_S0
Therefore it is not easy for them to accept others'views,let alone it is important to them.	I_S0
Meanwhil, this is not true of the youngsters, who are just entering the threshold of the society and can not nearly tell right from wrong.	I_S0
Besides, most of the youngsters show great passion for some certain famous celebrities.	I_S0
Their affection for them may give the priority to their opinions when considering some events.	I_S0
Hence it is naturally that their opinions are more important to the youngsters.	I_S0
Last but not least,there is usually some gaps between the younsters and their parents, which does not exist in their relationship with the celebrities.	I_S0
In this way, they tend to accept their opinions more..	E_S0
From the dissussions above, we can naturally draw the conclusion that the youngsters are more influenced by the famous people when taking some opin	O
 
Many people have friends and freindship takes an essential part in their hearts.	B_I0
Nevertheless, the principles of the making friends are different for the most of the people.	I_I0
Some people like making new friends more and more to expand their friendship nets.	I_I0
Others prefer to preserve  only a small amount of the friends and maintain the friendship to get the purest hearts of each other.	E_I0
In my opinion, I'd like to have the abillity to make more and more new friends easily.	S_T0
The more, the better.	S_S2
First of all, having the abillity to make more new friends can expand the net of the relationship of the people and benifit them more.	S_M1
With the increase of the friends, people will have wider and wider net of the relationship between each other.	B_S0
And the more friends you have, the more helps the friends will give you.	I_S0
When you in a difficult environment, many friends can give you help and you can recover from the difficulties more easily.	I_S0
For example, one of my sister's characteristic is very outgoing and she can make new friends easily.	I_S0
So when she wanted to hold a party of the company, she asked many friends to help her with the equipments of the party and many friends come and they have their own majors about the party such as controling the light, DJ music, the delicious food and so on.	I_S0
The party was such a success and the leader of the company praised my sister.	I_S0
That's the abillity of the making many friends easily.	E_S0
Secondly, we can learn many interesting experience from making many new friends easily.	S_M1
Sometimes there are some friends only visiting each ot	S_S2
Thirdly, sometimes only a small of the friends can know the heart of each other.	B_C0
Actually, it's true for the people to have only true friends.	I_C0
It's enough for the people.	I_C0
And also, many friends are not good so that you may get in trouble because of these  terrible friends.	I_C0
However, if you don't have the abillity to make friends easilly but few friends, you don't have many more true friends.	E_C0
 
Do some violent and blue plots in some movies or teleplays have negative effects to young people?	B_I0
And does the television has passive effects for our eyes?	I_I0
From my perspective, the behavior that watching television has more bad effects than positiev effects for young people.	E_I0
Since it is harmful for the growth of body and mind for the children.	S_T0
On the one hand, movies and television have negative effects to the growth of children's mind.	S_M1
To be more convincible, some movies that are not for children have large amounts of bad plots like the violent plot will enables the children to form some violent tendency.	B_S0
As a result, the children will favor the fighting and war, it is bad for their value and bad for them to grow up.	I_S0
There is no better illustration to prove this idea than the instance of my nephew Tom, which likes Bruce Lee extremely, and he is a primary school students.	I_S0
However, Tom fight with his classmate for some trifles every day, he always imitates the action of Bruce Lee and learning some skills about combat.	I_S0
Finally, Tom is checked up by the psychological doctor of a little violent tendency.	I_S0
Obviously, some parts of movies enables children can not to grow up healthily.	E_S0
On the other hand, movies and television are harmful for children's body.	S_M1
To be more specific, there are many bad effect for children, like the blue plots are harmful for childrens   development of sex function, and watching television more time will influences the eyes function and eyes upgrowth.	B_S0
For instance.	I_S0
First, prematurely touching the knowledge of the sex will enables children to have some condition of prococity, or enhance the probability of crimes.	I_S0
Second, the children's eyes are in a growing step, watching TV for a long time will influence the grow of eyes.	I_S0
Obviously, it is a bad choice for children to watch TV.	E_S0
Admittedly, there are many merit of waching TV like broaden up th	O
 
From my point of view, it is more advisable to relax by doing physical exercise instead of watching a movie or reading a book.	B_I0
Watching a movie or reading a book can actually help us relax and get us free from the pressure of working and studying, but doing physical exercis will play a much more pleasant role in relaxation.	E_I0
There are couple of reasons that can support my opinion.	S_T0
Initially, when doing physical exercise, we can totally get rid of the bothering trouble of working and totally enjoy ourselves doing sports.	S_M0
Take myself for example.	B_S0
I enjoy running a lot.	I_S0
In my sapre time, I will always run around the lake.	I_S0
When running, I can forget about all my pressure and trouble I meet during working hours, concentrating on running and sweating, which definitely helps me relax myself.	I_S0
Therefore, doing physical exercise is a great way to release our stress.	E_S0
To further back up, as is known to us all, doing physical exercise can contribute to our health and strengthen our bodies.	S_M0
After sitting on our chairs for long hours, what we need to do is to go out to do some physical activities.	B_S0
Only in this way can we avoid obesity and protect ourselves from deseases.	I_S0
Doing physical exercise is benefitial to improve our immune system and help us be in a good shape, on account of which should we choose the means of doing sportsto relax ourselves.	E_S0
Last but not least, during doing exercise, we can meet a lot of people that share the same hobby with us and make friends with them.	S_M0
To illustrate, my brother likes playing basketball to relax himself.	B_S0
When he plays basketball, he works in a team who share the happinese of winning the game the together.	I_S0
As a consequence, he meets a lot of people and makes friends with them.	I_S0
So I suggest to do physical exercise to relax.	E_S0
In a word, doing phisical exercise is abetter way better to relax.	S_C2
 
As we can know from the material,there is a discussion about if people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.	S_T0
I`m writing to here to present my current topic.	S_T1
From my perspective,I hold a positive view here.	S_M2
I totally agree with the behavior and appreciate it that the people who are willings to help the stuggling strangers should be respected .	B_S0
There are at least two reasons accounting for this.	I_S0
For one thing,with the development of the society,helping each others is supposd to be thinking important quality.	I_S0
For another, the struggling strangers should be treated by people kind and lovely.	I_S0
In additon,only in this way can we acheive the goals we desire.	E_S0
In a word, I believe it is dong that speaks louder,therefore,let`s action now.	S_C2
 
Having a glimse into this society, different vocations have different working patterns; for instance, some clock worker need to spend their all day to fix a closck's surface, while some company managers need to copy with a myriad tasks including analysis on market and counting for operation of company.	S_I0
For me, I definitely am into tune that workers are appealling when they face lots of different tasks.	S_T1
In the first place, working different takes can improve people's working effeciency because of the fresh air always imparted into work progress.	S_M0
For instance, when I prepare fore my final exam, I equally distributed my all time into several subjects and always study them orderly; in this way, I always felt exited and enjoyble when I exchanged to study new subjects.	B_S0
On the contrust, if I spend all day to study math, I would feel confused about its complex counting and distructed about its complicated geometry imagies.	I_S0
This way, accompy with this negative mood, I must have low effeciency and lose confidence for myselve.	I_S0
Thus, I prefer studying different types of tasks.	E_S0
Secondly, we can cultivate our ability to manage our time by working with different tasks.	S_M0
This ability is highly important for people because it can help us do everything well and organized.	B_S0
My ankle Daniel usually do one thing in company in the past, which always made him always miss lots of takes and he even felt that he did nothing in that day.	I_S0
After that, he started do several tasks including advertising, marketing and counting together.	I_S0
This working pattern force him always host fastly all the tasks in mind and finished them on time.	I_S0
Gradually, whatever takes are difficult and massive, he never fail to complish achievement for these.	I_S0
Therefore, working lots of taksts together can equipe people the ability to manage their time well.	E_S0
Finally, working with different tasks can make us well rounded because we face more kind of knowledge.	S_M0
In my university life, I chose five subjects including science, math and engineering.	B_S0
However, my classmates only major on science.	I_S0
At the end of term, I transfer from people who do not know anything to an exellent people has matery of lots of aspects of knowledge.	E_S0
To sum up, workers will more appealing when they face different kind of	O
 
Nowadays some people prefer to live with no plan or rule.	S_T1
Especially for young people, they like to live for free and do things whatever or whenever they want.	B_S0
However,i have a different opion ,when it comes to the statement that it is better to have the ability to plan and organize.	I_S0
There are some reasons why i feel this way:do things more effitient ,develop a good hobby,good for health.	I_S0
First of all have ability to plan and organize can make us do things faster.	I_S0
For example we young people all have lots of study things.	I_S0
They contins Math .	I_S0
English  Physics and so on.	I_S0
If we study with  no plan ,we will learn few things and do it slowly.	I_S0
But if we make a plan,decide how long or when should  we study and what to study first, things will be easier to solve.	I_S0
we can plan to practice Engalish in the morning then math phsics.	I_S0
It just take a little time to plan this.	I_S0
In addition ,plan can help us develop a good hobby.	I_S0
For example many young people dont clean their room on time.	I_S0
So there is mess .	I_S0
we need to plan and organized when and how many times we should clean our clothes and bedroom .	I_S0
It is better fo us to be more independent .	I_S0
there is one day we have to leave our paents.	I_S0
Last but not least, it is good for our health.	I_S0
Living with no plan will destroy our body slowly.	I_S0
We all used to go to bed so late and even stay up the whole night.	I_S0
That really harm our body.	I_S0
we young people dont eat on time.	I_S0
many students dont even eat.	I_S0
So the young peoples health are more concertrated by modern social.	I_S0
In general i srongly agree young people need to have the ability to plan and organize.	I_S0
Do things effietyient and good hobby and good health are very	E_S0
 
These days, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people : whether the ability to maintain friendship with a small group of people is more important than the ability to make friends easily.	S_T1
From my perspective, maintain friendship is more important and it can decide the happiness of people.	S_T0
My point will be elaborated as follows.	S_T1
Firstly, maintaining friendship can help people deal with some serious problems.	S_M1
people would alway meet with some problems which they can not handle by themselves.	B_S0
As the saying goes, a friend in need is a friend indeed.	I_S0
Only the friends who can pay their effort to help can be the best friend.	I_S0
So the happiness about friends is not depend on the quantity of the friends, but the quality.	I_S0
The ability to maintain frinedship with a small group of friend is just to strengenth the friends and turn this small group of friend into the friends indeed.	I_S0
However, making friends as much as possible with the ability to make friends easily has no benefits except going on the loose..	I_S0
For example, my roommate takes parts in many activities ranging from the basketball matches to the Student Union, which makes him easily access to many students with the same hobby and consequently being friends with them.	I_S0
However, when he got hurt in the basketball match, no one helped him.	I_S0
Living lonely in the hosptial without any one taking care of him.	I_S0
So he regreted that if he try to strengthen friends with our roommates or other several persons, it would not turn out to be like now that no ony care about him.	E_S0
Secondly, large percent of friends only share the hobby with a person, while only a small amount of friends can motivate each other to gain a higher position in the job.	S_M1
As we all know, the happiness is defined not only by enjoying the happy time together, but also determined by the position in the job or the achievment in finish the target.	B_S0
The ability to maintain the friendship with a small amount of people is meant to that these several people have the awareness that they share the same traget and goals in life.	I_S0
So the group of people can motivate each other or give a hand to each other about the driection towards the target.	I_S0
The same situation limit the amount of people, which means that there are no possibility to have many people in the same condition.	E_S0
So the ability to mai	S_S2
 
Many people would say that something happened around us is not important because they think that is not they business.	S_I0
I agree in some cases they don't need to care anout that.	B_T1
After all, some stars who divorce with their partner is  not enough to obtain our attention.	I_T1
However, in my opinion, some events are enough to change our life.	E_T1
Firstly, know some important news can improve our experience because when we know more about important news we can use it in our essay or discuss with friends.	S_M2
From these process we can learn more about extre knowledge.	B_S0
I remreber I saw a video about Syria war.	I_S0
A child because of the war he lost his home, and he can't found his parents.	I_S0
He had blood on his face but he didn't cry, didn't shout just sit there, and wipe his blood on his face.	I_S0
These video were spread on wibr site so many people know about	E_S0
 
With the development of Wuhan, more and more bike sharing sheme in our life.	B_I0
Some people belive the bike can bring us a comfortable life,and it also can lose the press of           .	I_I0
But the others think the bike like Mobike,ofo bike,Hello bike has bring a large numbers problen in our daily life.	I_I0
In my views, i keep the point that the bike sharing has the advantages and disadvantages.	E_I0
I want to includ the advantage of bike sharing at first.	S_M1
We must to       that it offer us a new way to solve our             .	B_S0
The  bike is esay to use and just need to spend a litter of money.	I_S0
If we buy a bike, we need to worry the safe for it,and we have had to move it in a safe local,it is to hard.	I_S0
But the problem has been solve when the bike sharing scheme in Wuhan, we need to buy a bike, just need to get a Mobike need not worry the theif again.	I_S0
In other way, the bike can help us to live a health life because when we use it, we can               our body.	E_S0
The bike sharing also has disadvantages.	S_M1
So many people worry their safe of money online,because the problem had happend that somebody found that they lost money and their cride card had been used by others.	S_S2

In this day and age  a controversial topic has aroued a heated debate among people whether people's job will make people more happier than social life does.	B_T0
Opinion vary from person to person.	I_T0
Some people claim that social life has more effect on poeple's happiness.	I_T0
However, contrary to these people's opinion is my perspectvie that compared with social life, job is more significant for people's happiness.	I_T0
My point will be elaborated as follow.	E_T0
To begin with, job can facilitate people to make more money, which can make people to be delighted.	S_M2
Because the more money they obtained, the better life they can enjoy, such like going vacation， more delicious food and better house.	B_S0
Compared with job, social life can not help people to enhance their life.	I_S0
Take my father as an example.	I_S0
at the beginning of  working, every month he only can earn 1500 RMB.	I_S0
He is afraid to spend money on beautiful cloth and deliciuous food and he always  feel hungry at night he feel very frustrated.	I_S0
However, ten year later he got a better job and every month he can earn 10000 RMB.	I_S0
He bought a nice car and he provide best education for me.	I_S0
I can feel that he is very happy.	E_S0
What is equally worth discussing is that during the job people‘s life will be full of prospect.	B_C1
Because as time gose on， people will have many chance to move up their career ladder， which can help them achieve their value.	E_C1
Take my brother as an example.	B_S0
When at 20 ages he liked socializing with others.	I_S0
Every day he hang out with his friends.	I_S0
Nevertheless, evey time when he went back to home he felt very empty without any happines.	I_S0
As a result, he decided to find a job in a media company.	E_S0
And three year later he move	O
 
From my point of view it is a great idea thet parents let their children make mistakes and lat them learn from their mistakes.	S_I0
To be start with when a kid is facing a task it is their bussiness to make a choice and they also should be responsible to their choice in this way the kid can have a think before make a choice it is a very important ability for a person and if parents do it like that so the kid can learn to be like that.	S_T0
Secondly inthe world we are living in is not simple if a man he never fall I think it is unnormal and once he is succeed and will not be happy because a person who is never fail can not be enjoyable when he is succeed in another words when kid is failing it is a very normal thing bacause a a part of their life if is a part that everyone must undergo.	B_M0
Thirdly it is true that parents know much more knowledge than their kids do and they can also use it to help their kid to make the right choice in this way a kid can go through a difficulty without any effort I think this kind of action can acually ruin this kids  because they even do not form their own value perspective and the most important thing is that they can just follow the order from their parents that there is nothing differen between them and a robot so when parents do it then a very serious problems may occured and they can do nothing to improve it that is a pity.	I_M0
Last this question is not to be or not to be it is about how to raise a kid and in hat kind of way can the kid grow up healthier and happier and when parents put their kids in danger they also do not mean to heart their children but want them to learn somethings that they can not teach so in is normal that when you are facing a task and you parents do not help you to go through it they want you to handle it when you failed you must find a solution on your own because your parents can not always stand behind you and give you a hand because one day you are on your own that is what we called gouw up.	E_M0
All in all I think this is helpful to the kids and it is ok to see the kids failing I know it is tough but they have to do it because it is good for their kids.	S_S2
 
I disagree that the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school for the future job.	S_I0
I think they are equally important.	S_T0
Firstly, studying hard is the foundation for successful career.	S_T1
Because good study means you are more prepared for the work.	S_T0
And if you find a good job, it's a perfect first step for career.	B_S0
For instance, when people look for a job, the employer will condsider if the person they hire could help them to get the work done.	I_S0
Obviously, the good grade is a good indication to judge if the person fits the job.	I_S0
If a person works hard in school and has a good grade, the person has much more chance to make good start in career.	E_S0
Moreover, the skills which are learned fom hard working are significant fot successful career.	S_M2
Like it's hard to imagine a good code programmer get poor grade in all his classes.	B_S0
Without the skills which a person can learn from hard working, the person can hardly do the job, which means basically the person will fail in the begining of career.	I_S0
It's very diffcult to study the skills when a person begin working.	I_S0
The person should pay much more time to study than do that in school.	I_S0
Because working is alway busy after graduation.	I_S0
As a reslut, the person can't accomplish task then he can't get a promotion, which means fail in a future job.	E_S0
Finally, it's also significant to have the ability to relate well to people.	B_C1
People are working toghter now days.	E_C1
So the teamwork is necessary for success career.	S_S2

There is a way to foster children that more and more wildly used by parents.	B_I0
That id offer their children money for each high grade they get in school.	E_I0
I think it is an ideal way to improve the learning effect.	S_T0
Here are reasons to support my perspective.	S_T1
Giving children award can stimulate children to learn.	S_M0
Given that now children are living in a peaceful world, they don't need to earn their living for food and cloth.	B_S0
They may just enjoy their life and see study as something useless.	I_S0
So, if we give them award ,they will be motivated to learn due to the things they want to get.	I_S0
We will be happy to see they work hard in math to earn their own money to buy the bicycle that they have desired for a few month.	I_S0
The story of my consin strongly prove this view.	I_S0
He used to think he don't need to learn bacause his parents will meet his every need only if he put forward it.	I_S0
But thing changed when his parents stopped to buy everything he wanted and offered him money when he got good grade.	I_S0
He is actually talented and after concentrating on learning, his grade improved a lot.	I_S0
The story of my consin, as well as other children's experience like him, give the reason a strong prove.	E_S0
The other reason for give child money for good grade is that this can cultivate their ability of managing money.	S_M0
Supposing that a child grow up and earn his money, but he can not use them well, how much will be wasted by him.	B_S0
If he learn how to use money in his childhood, it will be very beneficial for him.	I_S0
When Bufflet was young, his parent award him for good grade.	I_S0
He knew not only the importance of learning but also how to use money.	I_S0
It is the keystone of his success later.	E_S0
Some people may think that using money may let children study for a wrong purpose.	S_M0
What I want to say to those people is award is a right purpose for everyone.	B_S0
It can be money, fame or achievement etc.	I_S0
So I don't think it's a mistake to see money as an award, after all, most of the adult try their best only to earn more money.	E_S0
According to the two reason, I think parents can offer their children money for good grade.	S_C2
 
As far as I'm concerned,doing physical exercise is of more importance when it comes to relax.	B_T0
Personally speaking ,I do believe that people can relax themselves by watching a movie or reading a book,but when you compare these two methods with exercise,you will find doing exercise more benificial.	E_T0
my opinions are as followed:Firstly,watching a movie or reading a book makes people sit in the couch for hours,which is not a good way for health.	S_M1
On the contrary, doing physical exercise means that you should get off your chair to jog,to play ball games or to do something else.	B_S0
It's obvious that physical exercise transfers your mind from the work to your body,in which way you can relax your brain.	I_S0
Secondly,a movie is the idea of the director while a book is the idea of the author,but why should you let your free time spent in somebody else's mind instead of choosing to live your own life ?	I_S0
Through physical exercise,you can not only relax your mind,but you can learn to enjoy your life as well.	E_S0
Take me as an example.	S_M1
Whenever I feel tired or even exhausted,the first thing I ever think of is to put down the work that I'm doing to take a walk.	B_S0
My school is located nearby a beautiful mountain ,and I'm telling you that It's really a fantastic place which is worth your precious time.	I_S0
After walking for about an hour,including the view that I've enjoyed,the fresh air that I've breahted in and the wonderful sound of the silence,I‘m refreshed .	I_S0
Even it means I've got to finish my homework later,I will still gladly give myself to the nature and what's more?	I_S0
The physical exercise.	E_S0
As far as you can see, a man who is willing to spend time doing exercise understands the true meaning of relax.	B_C1
Not only because it gives him a good body,but it also means that he knows the beauty of life.	E_C1
 
I don't think this is a good idea.	S_T0
First,although stimulating children with moeny to study well and get a high score may lead to a short time benefits,it's not good for children's growing in the long term.	B_M0
Studying is the chil's own thing,reward children,I think should more attention to mental things.	E_M0
It also can start with your child‘s interest,like skating,listening a concert,travelling and so on.	B_S1
Let the children realize the sense of achievement in learning,and learn from the fun.	E_S1
Second,blind test scores or even let child to achieve a high score by cheating use unscrupulous,or become a bookworm.	S_M0

In the present social, the grade decides whether a student can enter an excellent school.	B_I0
It is believed by most parents that if you want to get high grade in school, you should spend money on claas.	I_I0
Now, more parents spend much money on class after school.	I_I0
I think it should be stopped and thinked about more time, The most important problem is increasing more presurre on children.	I_I0
It cost them mouch time to study in class.	I_I0
They will be really sad when they can not get a good grade.	I_I0
when I was a high school studet, my parents spent much money on my study.	I_I0
I had to go to study every weekends.	I_I0
I almost had no time for resting and playing.	I_I0
What I should do is only study.	I_I0
I studied day and night for a high grade.	I_I0
My parents told me if I can not get a great grade in test, I was a loser.	I_I0
I had much presurred when I failed in a exam.	E_I0
It is not beneficial for health of children.	S_T1
Then it is a big aford for most families.	S_M2
Many poor families have not much money for study of children.	B_S1
It is not fair that students have different study condition.	E_S1
It is not a good way that parents offer their children money for high grade.	B_C1
Children should be taught in a correct way.	E_C1
 
In modern society, majority parents are spoiling their children.	B_S0
They will try their best to meet children's needs.	I_S0
They is dying to help do everything for their children just because everything is for kids in their mind.	I_S0
However, it's good for children?	E_S0
As far as I'm concerned, I feel parents should let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.	S_M2
First of all, every child is an independence indivitual.	B_S0
They should be respected, especially their parents.	I_S0
Besides, everyone may makes mistakes in our daily life.	I_S0
There is no saying the children will make mistakes.	I_S0
Parents should allow children to make them.	I_S0
But the most important thing is  they should let their chhildren learn from their own mistakes as well, and teach them what lesson they have learned.	I_S0
Last but not least, parents can be children's frends.	I_S0
communite more and share more in our life.	E_S0
 
Lately, bike sharimg scheme is very popular in Wuhan.	B_I0
There are many bikes we can choose, such as Mobike, ofo bikeHello bike and so on.	E_I0
It is hard to say the bike sharing scheme is good or bad in one word.	S_T0
So I will tell my two different oppinions now.	S_T1
On one hand, the bike sharing scheme is convenient.	S_M1
Around my home, I can find Mobike and ofo bike everywhere.	B_S0
And there are many bikes I can choose.	I_S0
When I go to school, I can take one.	I_S0
And it is very to take one, just use our phone and open the apps, then you can ride away right now.	I_S0
Sometimes, if I go shopping with my friends, we will choose ride a bike instead of walking or taking a bus.	E_S0
Then, another advantage is that Mobike and ofo bike always free, which means you do not have to pay for it after using the bike.	S_M1
It is really favourable, bacause you can use a free bike.	B_S0
And there are many activities the bike sharing scheme company will do.	I_S0
If you take a bike on weekends, you always do not have to pay for it.	E_S0
On the other hand, the bike bike sharing scheme also has some disadvantages.	B_C0
It is hard to govern.	I_C0
Altough, we can see the bikes everywhere, they always in a mess.	I_C0
We just put it optional and do not put them in a line.	I_C0
And nobody to govern them.	E_C0

The number of people is increase rapidly.	S_I0
With icreasing of needs in resources,like food, clothes, and buildings, the opinion of protecting wild animal and wildness areas is smothen.	B_T1
However, I strongly believe that it is significant for future generation to protect wild animals and wilderness areas.	E_T1
First of all,wild animals is a important part of the whole enviromen because every part in nature play a role in connecting the enviromental curve and  hold the balance of nature.	S_M2
For exanple, the big fisth will eat the small fish, but if there is no big fish, the small fish will be too more.	B_S0
For the same reason, the wild animal and wildness areas need to be protected to give a balance enviroment with green trees and beautiful flowers.	I_S0
In addition, the wild woof ate sheep which was fed by pelple to earn money, living in Nei Menggu in China, so they really heated the woofs.	I_S0
They desided to kill the woofs to protect their sheep.	I_S0

From my perspective, I disagree with that the ability to relate well to people is of greater importance than studying hard in school for gaining success in a future job.	B_I0
Nowadays, lots of people advocate the importance of the ability of socialization and think low of studying hard.	E_I0
As for this statement, I could only feel pity for them for their lack of foresight.	S_T1
First and foremost, no matter how great the ability to relate to people is, if you don't study hard in school, you will lack a core competitiveness in the future career life.	S_M0
Let me illustrate this idea with my own major.	S_S2
As for a student majoring in elctric and electronic engineeing, it's of great essence to equip yourself with various kinds of technological abilities for your future job in projects.	S_M0
In addition, these kinds of abilities can only accessed by working hard through countless practices.	B_S0
If you only concentrate on socialization ability in school and neglect the significance of studying, you surely can't get the hang of these techniques.	I_S0
In the future, when your leader allocate some assignments demanding these techniques on you, your ability to relate well to your boss can do nothing helpful!	I_S0
To sum up, the abilities acquired by working hard in school serve as core competitiveness for you, and this competitiveness it the basic for your career success.	E_S0
I'm not saying that socialization ability is not important.	S_M0
But for the period in school, study is out of question the primary task and responsibilty for students.	B_S0
Other abilities like the ability to relate well to people, as far as I'm concerned, are secondary.	I_S0
They will also help a lot when you have trouble communicating with workmates, showing your confidence or making business friends.	I_S0
But we are talking about the time in school, all of these secondary abilities can be trained and gained throuth our whole life, but it's hard for us to spare a large amount of time to bulid up our core competitiveness after we graduate.	E_S0
As a result, it's indispensable to study hard in school rather than spend the precious school time concentrating on other less significant things.	B_C1
And this can best prepare us for the future success in a job!	E_C1
 
There's a growing number of parents offering their schooling kids money for each high grade, and it received lots of contradictory opinions.	S_I0
Of all the opinions, I think it's a good idea to do so for multiple reasons.	S_T0
First of all, to those don't like studying, money can serve as a stimulant for them to pursue higher grades, and it's nothing wrong to get a good grades.	S_M0
And to those already have good grades, money will encourage them to keep giong and even get better.	B_S0
Psychology tells us we all need inspiration and happiness to do laborious works, either physically or mentally.	I_S0
And in this case, if our kids just study and get nothing encouraging, they will probably lose interest in it.	E_S0
Many school-age children still don't know how to make a plan, but giving money when getting good grades provides as an good example of how to plan.	S_M0
Getting money is a target, and to achieve that target, you need to lieten to the teacher carefully in class, do homework carefully and review schoolwork thoroghly.	B_S0
See, this is a plan--target oriented and process detailed.	I_S0
Through this, kids will learn how to achieve a goal and make them better plan-makers.	E_S0
Although, many people will argue that kids will spend money on useless things, I think we might as well take this as a chance.	S_M0
We all know that managing one's money is very important if one want to be economy-independent.	B_S0
You have to make a balance between in and out.	I_S0
And if we give them money before they are eco-independent, this is a chance that they can learn somethng ecomonical in advance.	I_S0
Besides, there's no need to give real money.	I_S0
Parents can set a "Mom bank account" for their kids, and give virtual cash to their kids which can be used to "buy" something they want.	E_S0
To conclude, giving money for getting good grades are benefitial in many ways.	B_C0
It can encourage kids to study better, teach them how to make plans, or even teach them how to manage their own money.	I_C0
So why not have a try?	E_C0
 
With the development of information circulation, we are exposed to a great flood of what is happening around the world, which may be amusing, ironic and provoking.	B_T1
However, a recent debate focuses on whether it is vital for everyone to know about what is happening around the world even though the events have not affected our daily life.	E_T1
From my perspective, I agree that we should concern about what is happening.	S_T0
Firstly, since human society is a interrelated one, although these events are not directly affeted us, they are bound to impose influence on us in the long run or indirectly.	S_M0
Everyone has his social circle, which includes relatives, classmates, colleges and so on.	B_S0
For example, the fact that one of my classmate falls his math examination does not related to me directly, but it may indicates that the teacher who teaches the class makes the tests more tough.	I_S0
If I know about it and ask my classmate, I am likely to handle the course better in the future.	E_S0
Moreover, thinking about what is happening can broaden our horizons and help us learn from it.	S_M0
We cannot learn lessons all by suffering ifrom some experiences.	B_S0
Therefore, we have to learn from others' experiences and avoid making the same mistakes when we ourselves face the same problem.	I_S0
For instance, if a friend of mine suffered from copying others' homework and received severe punishment, I will not do that in the future.	I_S0
Also, some events happen in the fields we are not familiar with, like a breakthrough in the botany.	I_S0
By learning about the events, we are able to 000 and open up a new world.	E_S0
Although to know about all the events around us takes time and energy, it is worth to do so.	S_M0
We have to spend time socializing and relaxing and it costs nothing if we try to concern more about what happens around us and in the other corners in the world when others are playing computer games and drinking in the bar.	S_S2
Above all, we can safely conclude that knowing more about something which is not related to us is crucial.	B_C1
Not only can it prepares us for probable events coming to us, but also it can broaden our horizons and give us lessons.	E_C1
 
Recently, there is a heat discussion about whether it is easier to identify what type of job or careew will lead us to successful  future in the past time.	B_I0
Some people believe that the people who living in the past time would identify the job or career easily because the competition was not fierce as the modern time so the false informations is less.	I_I0
However, other hold a dissimilar viewpoint that the people living in the modern time will easier to distinguish the job or career whether good for us.	E_I0
As for me i agree the latter one.	S_T0
my reason and example are listed as follows.	S_S2
One reason why i am in favorof my point is that the techology in the modern time can assist us to identify the type of job or career whether are suited for for us.	S_M1
this is because with the develpopment of society, we can use the technological proudct such as competer can help us to get more messagr about a job, which can help us to identify the work whether can lead us to success.	B_S0
A good exampple is myt borther, he used to get message on interland, so he can early knowing of what job is most promising.	I_S0
So when he graduated, he chosed to get a IT job and he obtaind many achivement.	E_S0
Another relevant reason used to support my opinion is that we can mke many different type friends in morden time and they can assist us to identify which job or career is best for us.	S_M1
this is beacuse the modern techonoigical can help us to get more friends, different form friend can offer you different konweldge, which can help us to get more cahnce to realize other type of job or career.	B_S1
Atypical illustration of this can be seen is my father.	E_S1

As we advance into this information explore period, we can recieve a myriad kind of information through internet.	B_I0
Is these so much information a good thing for us?	E_I0
I undoubted keep in tune with the fact that so much trivial information creates lots of problems.	S_T1
In the first place, lots of recreation information will distract people from their working or studying.	S_M0
For instance, in our class, there are lots of female students are big fans of Justin Bieber.	B_S0
They never fail to use internet easily searching a myriad information of their icon such Bieber's clothes and Bieber's girlfriend.	I_S0
However, they always use whole day to search information of Bieber rather than forcusing on their homework and university club, which sets up a huge barriel in their studying life in my opinion.	I_S0
Therefore, these unrelative information on internet creates huge diration for people recently.	E_S0
Aside this negative impact, so much information on internet provide destructive attack on my physical and psychological health.	S_M0
It is a generally accepted fact internet enable people use a phone or computer to see anything they want without moving their body.	B_S0
This way, when I have free time, I prefer watching NBA games, a myriad international news and lots of electronic books rather than doing some exercise and hiking with my friends.	I_S0
Consequently, owing to the absence of exercise, my eyesight degrade rapidly and I always have ill.	I_S0
Furthermore, I gradually fear to communicate and have less friends because I almost spend all my time on internet rather than doing some social work.	E_S0
Although some people think that internet can expand people's outlook because we can see something we never see on internet.	S_M0
Nevertheless, I totally disagree with this point because there are lots of fake information on internet can we can not check it; therefore, reading these information is just a waste of time.	B_S0
It is known to all time the more people clik the websit, the more money websit can earn.	I_S0
In way, lots of people use this mean to make up fake attractive informaion we have been never say in order to make money.	I_S0
Therefore, so much information on internet waste our too much time, Thus, so much information is not a good thing for us.	E_S0
To sum up, a myriad informatin on internet creates lots of problems rather than provide us valuable benefits due to facts that  distration, bad impacts on healt	S_C2
 
Have you ever see some advertising which encourage people to take more public transportationt?	B_I0
nowadays, more and more people are choose to commute on subway or bus.	I_I0
The car are fewer and fewer than before.	E_I0
Therefore, as a metter of fact, there will be less car in twenty years than today.	S_T1
To begin with, public transportations are well developed than before, it means people can reach  most the place they want to go by public transportations.	S_M1
In fact, public subway or bus are more chip and faster than car.	B_S0
For instance, if one person need to reach his company, it may takes 1 or 2 hours to get there by car for the heavy transport, and it may cost a lot of money.	I_S0
However, if he takes subway to get to his coporation, it can take few time and save a large amount of money.	I_S0
As a result, he will choose the second way without doubt.	I_S0
And this phenomenon is very common nowadays.	E_S0
On the top of that, the air pollution nowadays have become more and more serious, most of people are even afraid to go outdoor.	S_M1
And reduceing the number of car is good way to reduce the pollution.	B_S0
In fact, the fossil fule which used in car are play a main character on the pollution of air.	I_S0
According to the experiments, reduceing the use of the fossil fule can reduce the pollution dramtically.	I_S0
So if most of the people commute by public transportaion, the less fossil fule would be burned, and the sky would be clear again.	E_S0
Though the car always be a symbol of reach and poweful for people when they can buy it.	B_C1
However, the envirment will be damaged be the more use of car, so the loss is overweight the benifit.	E_C1

I do not think that is a good idea for students.	B_T0
In my opinion, if the students want to study, then he will study very well.	E_T0
However,  if he does not want to study, none of the things will make him to study include money.	S_S2
First, student will depend on the way to study instead of studying independetly.	S_M1
If the parents give the money each time for the good grade, he thinks that he will study for money instead of himself.	B_S0
The significance is different.	I_S0
The final goal of studying is not only studying knowledge in the book, we also study the rules of being a good person.	I_S0
If students will over rely on the way to gain money, they will not foucs on studying.	I_S0
Moreover, it will even lead a very bad result.	I_S0
For instance, some stdudents want to get some money to buy the things that they want.	I_S0
They may cheat on quizs or tests in order to get good grades.	I_S0
Unfortunately, that disobeys the first goal of studying.	E_S0
Sceondly, this behavior will leave some bad ideas or thoghts in students' brain.	S_M1
This behavior will cause the demands of spending money.	B_S0
Once, they join in the big society when they find a job, they will find out the way to gain money has changed.	I_S0
In this way, this knid of students will not integrate the working environment.	I_S0
Thus, this behaivior is not a good idea fro the parents who give their children money as a prize for getting good grades.	E_S0
All in all, I do not think that is a good idea for students.	B_C1
I think these two points of views could express my respect.	E_C1
 
In my opinion,it is about two reasons that some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.	S_T0
First of all,more parents expect their children to receive widely eduact as well as earlier.	S_M2
With the development of echonomic,pressure moving fast when parents aware it.	B_S1
So their want their children to learn more skills that make sure they could keep their competics.	E_S1
secondly,to the child ,they may have a gift on some way,fortunally their parents find it and support th	O
 
Have a glimpse on this society, with the fostering of the life quality, people prefer to have a travel with their family in the free time.	B_I0
Some people are willing to have a trip in their hometown maybe owing to the sence of belonging.	E_I0
On the contrary, some people including me think it is better to travel to the foreign countries simply because we can broaden our horizen and make more new friends.	S_T0
Firstly, Traveling to foreign countries extremely attracts me owning to the generally-accepted fact that we can learn more different interesing tradition and respecting rituals.	S_M1
My own experience successifully illustrates this point.	B_S0
Last Christmas I vist my sister,Jane, who lived in America.	I_S0
In the eve dinner, when I was gonna to have a chiken, he stoped me and told me that all the family members should gather togather and wisper a prayer for thanking for the gold.	I_S0
That time athough I was a little asshamed, a confusion emerged in my mind that why we needed to that since we never do this in my country.	I_S0
Jane told that this is the native tradition for the Christs.	I_S0
The prayer for the gold can give our good luck in a new years.	I_S0
This experience is highly magical for me result in the fact that I learned a lot of new cultures in the foreign coun tries.	E_S0
Futuremore, we not only can see the different landscape but also can eat new appealing food that we have never eat by travelling all over the world.	S_M1
For instance, I live in WuHan for eighteen years old.	B_S0
The all gardens, rivers, shops and every recreation pubilication are familar for me.	I_S0
Out of the study I just want to stay at home result in the boring  traveling in my city for me.	I_S0
And then I have a travel with my friend in England.	I_S0
The everyday for me is exciting and attracting due to the fact that the old style structure is different with what building Wuhan has.	I_S0
Futuremore, sweet as the humberger is, it still attracts me since I taste the different flavor of food.	I_S0
These experiences let me enjoy travel to the foreign countries.	E_S0
To sum up, I am a outgoing boy who want to taste different food and see the different landscape which I never see.	B_C1
Undoubtedly, traveling to foreign countries can satisfies me all of these things.	E_C1
 
Nowadays, parents gradually have lesser time to accompany their children.	B_I0
Their busy work and fully schedules often take their time away from stay with the kids.	E_I0
Thus, it is important to make the best use of the limit time.	S_T0
I recommend that parents should spent their time to playing sports with their children and following are my reasons.	S_T1
Firstly speaking, sport is a great activity to increase the familiar affection.	S_M0
Because the limit time the parents take to spent with their kids, it is possible for the family to gradually grow a boundary.	B_S0
Sport is a activity that need a sense of cooperation and trust.	I_S0
Thus, parents and children can fix their relationship by playing games or sports.	I_S0
My cousin usually play football with his dad after his work.	I_S0
Compare to the parents that do not play sports with their kids, my consin and his family are really in a good relationship.	I_S0
Therefore, the exercises like sports can build up a firm relationship for the family.	E_S0
Secondly, due to the tedious work and hard schedule of the parents, play games or sports can actually help them to relax.	S_M0
Parents nowadays often have a extrem pungent work and so do the children.	B_S0
Therefore, a relaxing game or sport after the work can help them to decrease their stress.	I_S0
In addition, due to the sedentary working habit, lots of people will catch a cold or have other office illness.	I_S0
Playing games or sports can also help them to keep away from being sick and provide them a healthier family.	E_S0
Finally, lots of people think that it is crucial for the parents to use their free time to do things such as schoolwork with their children.	S_M0
They might think this strategy can have a improvement to the grade of the students.	B_S0
However, we must know that the grade is not everthing.	I_S0
Many children nowadays are suffering mental diseases due to the hard pressure of the schoolwork.	I_S0
In China, especially，many students cannot keep up with their hard classes and due to the careless of their parents, they choose a way to end up their lifes.	I_S0
Thus, in order to get rid of this kind of tragedies, as a parent, it is more vital to take care of the mental health of their kids instead of their grades.	I_S0
Playing games and sports with children after work help kids free from their schoolworks and also give a peaceful to the entire family.	E_S0
All in all, games and sports are not merely activies that are fun to play.	B_C1
Spending time to play games and sports not only do good to the children, this strategy also has benefit to parents themselves.	E_C1
 
Today,some people disscuss whether should parents let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes or not.	S_I0
This is a very important problem beacuse it involve with children‘s growth.	B_T0
From my point of view,I think making mistakes,however,are not a bad thing.	E_T0
It can help children to know by themselves what is right and what they can't do.	S_S2
The following are my reasons.	S_T0
Firstly,if a child never make mistakes under his parent's conduct,he may looks like a very good boy.	S_M2
But,when he leave his parent one day,without his parent's conduct he is very likely to make mistakes,then he can't deal with it good on his own.	B_S0
so,he will be very puzzled and don't know what he can do.	I_S0
Moreover,when a child make mistakes,the bad consequense will offen leave him a deep impression.	I_S0
so,next time,when he meet the same condition,he will clearly know he can't do this.	I_S0
although,sometimes he also make this mistake,he will remind the experience which he get last time and deal with it correctly.	I_S0
Futhermore,It also can make children become more independent and can deal with things on his own.	E_S0

In such a high technology modern society, which is filled with the political prejudices and distinct views to policies or society.	B_I0
People are more likey to talk about their ideas about political problems.	I_I0
And nowadays, there is a issue that whether it is advisable for teachers to acknowledge the views of themselves to their students in the classroom.	E_I0
Some hold that it will have some benificial development for students' study.	B_T0
In my opinion, however, this is just soem private thinking political of tutors and there is no apparent evidence to prove it will have some benefit to students' learning.	E_T0
First and foremost, teachers' own judges of political views in the classroom will be a waste of time.	S_M1
Can you imagine that what things would be like when we are faced with high academic pressure, we still have to know others' views of political issues?	B_S0
The consequence will become that student will step into a distraction  which could lead to most of student are lack of time to contribute themselves into their studies.	I_S0
This is quite hard for us to study when we are in a highly and nervous learning circumstance.	E_S0
Moreover, political issues or views of teachers will adjust us to a pole which may be sheerly opposite to others' judgements, which could lead to a debate or some arguements.	S_M1
For instance, during the chinese history, there was an outstanding person in last centrery, Deng xiaoping, who has changed the china from a shortcoming country to a competely flourish empire.	B_S0
But however, his thinking of the political issues are old which means the idea of the last generation, which occasionally opposite to the political thinking of this president.	I_S0
And Mr.Deng always be less caring nowadays.	E_S0
So, caring the political issues or views is not good for us, wh	O
 
With the social developement, people need not worry about house and foods, so, parents gradually attachment importance on their children's education.	S_I0
but children do not have enough self- discipline about their study, so  some parents begin to give their children some money for ecourage high grade in school, as far as I am consider, this is a good idea for the following reasons.	S_T1
Firstly speaking, give some money to children when they get high mark in school can encourage them study better.	S_M0
because children have not develope their own world-thought, they can not aware of the importance of hard-working, maybe sometimes, they treat their grade only like a number on the paper, they don't think a good grade is important.	B_S1
so if people make some prize(such as money) for every higher grade, that may make them taste the happyness of scusse, they would be hard-working for that prize, and mantaining a higher grade would be more easier.	E_S1
Second, make money as a prize for every higher grade can intro them to govern there fortain early.	S_M0
nowdays, increasingly number of cheating happened in our socialty, such as net-cheat, some teenagers begin to invest more money in video games.	B_S0
I think the real reason for this atmosphere is children can not aware of the value of every coins, for our parents, just 1 yuan means working for some minuents, but when children acquire money from their parents, they just spend money without thinking.	I_S0
so if parents give their children money just when they get higher grades, that may help them know  every coins comes harder, they should govern their pocket-money seriously.	E_S0
Admittedly, school-age children are too young to attach money, some people though children should be naive for their study, parents should not make them become sophisticated ealier.	S_M0
but this opinion lose faith for teachers and parents' govern.	B_S1
and on the other hand,  children can use money buy what they like, so that can help parents know their children better, because just from what the children bought, parents can know their children's hobbies better.	E_S1
These are resons why I agree with the statement, and I think parents give their children money as prize for high grade is a good way to encourage them.	S_C2
 
Nobody born with some certain ability and all people are equivalent when they come to this word.	S_T1
Thus, leadership is obviously not initiative.	S_T0
We can cultivate this ability from a myriad of aspects.	S_T1
In the first place, commuting ability is a crusial characteristic for a leader and this ability is easily mastery.	S_M0
For instance, before I came into university, I never thought that I can be the team leader.	B_S0
However, I paticipated in the basketball club in our university.	I_S0
In our team, I need to found each team mates' mistakes and figured them out,which obviously enable me the ability to communicate with other in a indirect tune.	I_S0
In addition, when we prepare for the international basketball games, I needed to design the most effective strategy; therefore, I had to told with them about their own niche and how to pass the ball more fastly.	I_S0
Gradually, I was mastery of communicating ability to negotiate with different kinds of people and finally my team mates recommented me to be the leader in our basketball team.	I_S0
This experience teach me that leadership is not a initiate ability and it can be learned easily.	E_S0
Secondly, leaders are supposed to equaip with responsibility, which can be cultivated in future.	S_M0
The story of my little brother,Daniel, can successifully illustrate this opinion.	B_S0
It is a common fact that most little children hate to assume the mistakes sometimes and Daniel is not an exception too.	I_S0
However, my mother patiently teach him how to be a leader with responsibility: when daniel fail to do something, my mother request him to find mistakes from himself.	I_S0
Gradually, Daniel perspective that leaders can not escape from mistakes and they need to find their own shortage and fix them.	I_S0
Additionally, they need to help team mates out.	I_S0
Finally, Daniel become a qualified leader with responsibility through teaching by mother.	E_S0
Finally, leaders need to have calm cognity to copy with emergency and this ability can be learned.	S_M0
For instance, people who lack this ability can attempt to be host.	B_S0
The reason is that to be host need talk calmly in front lots of audiance.	I_S0
Furthermore, hosts need to think what to do is most appreciate in short time.	I_S0
All of this behavior can practive one people's clam perspective.	I_S0
Undoubtely, this ability is a essential part of good leaders.	I_S0
Thus, people completely can learn how to be a leader through learning.	E_S0
To sum up, leardeship is not initiative abi	S_S2
 
now ,television adverting is around in our daily life .	S_I0
every day on the scream , we always can look many advertising,i disagree that point .	B_T1
in this time many children are not like our can go to school everyday or eat good food everyday .	E_T1

These years, a main concern on workers' satisfication about their work has been risen up and disscussed by the public with much enthusiasm.	B_I0
Some people claims that the workers would gain more satisfication when they deal with mutiple-tasks during the workday rather than do similar tasks repeatly in the same day.	E_I0
In my perspective, the argument is reasonable and should be accepted by working systems in the enterprises to some degree.	B_T0
Also, several reasons and examples will be present below to support the point of view.	E_T0
It should not be ignored that doing similar tasks all day long would more likely to stimulate the negative emotions among the workers.	S_M1
It tends to be much boring for the workers to do one single task in the whole day.	B_S0
By contacting a variety of types of tasks, the brains of workers could become more active during the operation.	I_S0
Some easier tasks could even be regarded as a temporary break for the workers to refreash their mind and adjust themseleves into a sufficient energy to handle the tasks in an more effective approach.	E_S0
Moreover, it has been considered that different types of tasks provide workers a chance to challenge themslves in the workplaces.	S_M1
Obsorbing more knowleage and stategies about the works, the workers would gain more practical skills and working experiences from it and even benefit the improvement of their career in the future, For instance, one of my relatives used to be a nomal worker in a factory without high diplomas.	B_S0
Once he started to learn more types of tasks in the factory, he has stopped work in that factory anymore and started his own business.	I_S0
Now it has to say he becomes a successful businessman among his peer and recieved respect from others.	E_S0
Overall, having many different types of tasks to do during the working obviously has more advantges instead of just doing one task.	S_C2
 
At present, a controversial topic has aroused a heated debate among students: whether it's better to communicate in person with colleagues and classmates than by mail to do a project.	B_I0
Answers vary from one to another.	E_I0
Some people claim that it's proper to take in person to finish a work task while contrary to their perspective comes my own view that using mail is best way to communicate with partners .	B_T0
My viewpoint is based on the following reasons.	E_T0
First, sending email can elevate work efficiency and save time, which is conducive to completion of a project.	S_M1
To be more specific, people can send mails anytime and anywhere.	B_S0
If they want to inform their colleagues of somethinf important such as data, date and location, they just need to type the necessary messages briefly on the computers and then click the "send" buttom.	I_S0
It's really fast!	I_S0
However, if people choose to talk to their coworkers in person, they need to make an appointment in advance to make sure the collueagues have time for the talk and people also need to find places for the talk.	I_S0
It's so troublesome and a waste of time.	I_S0
For example, my uncle Jack who works in a bankoften deals with different projects in his work as a work group leader.	I_S0
He always asks his fellow workers to use mail as the way of communication.	I_S0
If the groupmates need some important data which needs to used in the presentation such as the interest rates of the coupons and bonds last year and the yield rates of the finance products, they just send e-mails between each other, which will eliminate the time and then raise the work efficiency of the whole group.	E_S0
Second, using emails is more accurate than talking in person.	S_M1
Specifically, messages presented by emails are longlasting and cannot be changed thus  the accuracy is the biggest advantages of sending mails.	B_S0
However, if people choose to talk to their colleagues, chances are that they make mistakes in remembering some critically important infomation and then tell the wrong messages to their coworks.	I_S0
In this case, the group will use the mistaken information as the referrence for their work and finnaly cause great loss.	I_S0
For example, I once worked with my classmates as a team to participate with a mathematic competition.	I_S0
During the procedure, we needed a precise data for our computer programs and  I thought I remember the concrete value and then I talked to my mates directly by phone calls rather than  searched for the value by computer and send emails.	I_S0
In fact, I made a huge mistake about the decipher and finally we lost the game.	E_S0
In conclusion, sending e-mail is better to finish a project for it can not only raise the work efficiency but also keep accurate recards.	S_C2
 
Education is certainly the most important thing to chrildren nowadays,and the phenomenon of parents rewarding their children for their high grades in exam still remains a controvertial issue.	S_I0
In my point of view, I assert that this is a good idea and a efficient way to stimulate children's interest in study, and it can also bring some other benifits.	S_T1
Initially, offer children extra money as bonus can urge children to study harder.	S_M1
When they recieve the award they earn themselves,they shall think that all the effort they paid is worthy,therefore, they would study in high mood instead of complaing about the difficulties.	B_S1
This is a virtuous cycle, good mood help them to recite note efficiently,which in return turn in to good marks and the next bonus.	E_S1
Secondly,this can boost the relashionship developement between parents and children.	S_M1
Take myself as an example, my father promised to me that he would give me a large number of money if I could be qualified to my dream junior high school,but he ate his words.	B_S0
I had an argument with him,let he knew he should complete his promise.	I_S0
After that,he promised me he would give me 500RMB whenever I get a progress,and this make our relationship steadier.	I_S0
So , the award would let children feel the honest of their parents,hence they can get closer to each other.	E_S0
To summarize,offering children money as award to their grade is an essential way to help children get better grades and gather the family together	O
 
When people talking about modern life, some people always focus on what is young people should do.	B_T0
Some people think it's really not that necessery to make paln, even nowadays, modern life is very complex.	I_T0
My personal opinion is to have the ability to plan and organize is very helpful to young peoples' life.	E_T0
First, eveything in modern life has become time-consuming.	S_M1
All we were spand lots of time on work, social life, just a little time we spare but often we had no choose but use it on sleeping.	B_S0
Some times young people really wants to do something , but turns out they has no time to do with it.	I_S0
So, the ablilty to paln and organize can save our time, expecially for young people.	I_S0
For example, a young guy wants to study playing guitar but always no time do do it because he just take part in a large company and very buzy.	I_S0
So, he makes a plan which write about what should he do on next week, and someday latter, he finds out it does work because as he use to be, some sort of free-time he just ignored and use it to do some meaninless thing, like play the phone.	E_S0
Second, sometime ,we organizing ability can accelerate our working process, inprove our work efficaincy.	S_M1
When we do some random also un-organized often make us no clue to finish it all, that bigest problem is make a person lose his faith to do every thing.	B_S0
So, the ability to plan and organize can let young people solve those massive number of work one by one and never wondered what next thing they should do.	I_S0
When we solve them all we look back acturlly, that is unbeliveble.	E_S0
For summary, the ability to plan and organize can let young peoples' life and work become more effciency, also save them lots of time to do everything they want, make their life better.	S_C2
 
In such a competitive socirty, many parent are paying an increaseing amounts of attention to their comprehensive abilities, like communicating skills, and other.	B_I0
So parents are all likely to find a way to improve these kinds of abilities.	I_I0
And in my opinion, learning history courses is a very good away to improve your comprehensive abilities, no matter what what our field of study is, in my opinion, learning history have benefits to all kinds of students.	E_I0
So I agree with the statement.	S_T0
First, learnig history can improve your artistic appreciation.	S_M1
Because history is telling the famous thinngs in the past time, and it is unavoidable to notice some cultural things like poems and songs, these things are contained the intelligence and  the opinion  of society.	B_S0
For example, when we leanig the Tang dinasty history, we can also learn many famous poem that written by many well-know writer like LIbai and Dufu.	I_S0
They were borned in different time of the dinasty, and if you read their poem prudentialy, you can find out that they have different opinion with the traditional   culture, and these could help you to become a leader when talking with others in a group.	E_S0
Second, history can help us  to develop our leading ability.	S_M1
For example, it is common to see that many history stories are about every empiror in different dinasties, and you can know how to create a big dinasty and lost a dinasty.	S_S2
You can learn the good thing of them like decisive thun	O
 
As the society develops fast, the competition between the employees has become more stiff.	S_I0
Thus how to gain competitive power to success in a future job has drawn people's attention.	S_T1
Althuogh some people contends that study hard in school is of significance for the reason that we have to apply to the knowledge we learnt to our work, I strongly believe that the ability to get along well is more important since we can seek help for the coworkers when we are in trouble.	B_T0
Moreover , we can learn from others.	E_T0
To begin with, to relate well to people help us overcome the difficulties we face in our work.	S_M2
As the saying goes well, no one can live indepently in nowadays society which means that we people have to establish relations with others can help each other in our life.	B_S0
So does our works.	I_S0
Getting along well with others means that we have more oppourtuninities to obtain assistance when we are faced with difficulties in our work.	I_S0
Take my brother for example.	I_S0
Although he has been working for several years , he has many things to say when he began his work.	I_S0
He said that when he first attended company ,he had many things he did not understand .	I_S0
But he had the ability to get along well with others so he could always seek others for help and learned.	I_S0
Steps by steps, he handled well with his work due to the ability.	E_S0
What is more , to related well to people help us to learn from others thus we can do a good job in our work.	B_C1
No one can be a master of all the skills which is necesaary in our work.	E_C1
So to learn from others is of vital importance.	S_S2
Therefore how to get along well with others is a indispensible skills	O
 
Some people think it is a good idea,because the student will study harder than before to make some money by that way,and they're passion will increase in the study.	S_I0
The other people disagree,they think   study is students' personal thing,if we use this way to let them know  study can make money,they will just think about money,and they can't enjoy the study's relax,they will just think study is a way tomake money,and they will also can't study the real thing.	S_T1
I think it's not the best way.	S_M2
They will more care about money insted of  knowledge.	B_S0
It will lead to they will do some bad things when they grow up to get some money.	I_S0
And whatever they do, they will just think about how much money they can get.	I_S0
They just want more and more money.	E_S0
But if we don't do this thing,we just teach them know the study is their personal thing,whatever their grade is higher or lower,it can't influence the other people except themselves.	B_C0
It will change their mind and make them more knowledgeable,it will also influence their salary in the future.	I_C0
And we will also tell   them study is a happy thing.	I_C0
If they get good grade,they will feel very happy.	E_C0
So I think some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school is a bad choice.	B_S1
We should set them up a right sense of worth,it is more important than the money.	E_S1
 
Group study plays an important role in students' daily life, but whether or not work together will learn much more effitively than those who asked to work alone on projects.	B_I0
Some people claim that working alone can help improve concerntration and do not disturbed by others.	E_I0
As far as I am concerned, however, I believe that working together have more effictively and can reap more achievement.	S_T0
To begin with, group study will get more things down in a short period of time owing to explicit divide th work.	S_M1
In a team, each people have different part of work, so all of them have a sense of responsibility to work hard in order to acquire a wonderful results.	B_S0
Moreover, different people will have different opinions which can provide some essential and useful suggestion to this group, and then the group leader will guild the team member to find a beat direction to slove the group assignment.	I_S0
Take myself as example, copared with those teacher who often make his students study alone, our English teacher usually assign us must work together and we have a excellent consequece about the assignments quality.	I_S0
Therefore, I believe that work together are much more effictively than work alone.	E_S0
On top of that, students also can acquire some specific skills during group study, which is the cornerstone to help students become well-rounded.	S_M1
Working together not only can improve students' study efficienct, but also can help them obtain communication skill, leadership and the ability of teamwork.	B_S0
As a students, although study is important, he also need to social network in order to adapt the society in advanced.	I_S0
However, if students just work alone, he does not have more chances like those people who work together to get in touch with different classmate and express his own perspective.	I_S0
At that time, he will lost the opportunity to exchange opinion with each other, which will decrease the study efficieny.	E_S0
Judging from these evidences, we may safely arrive at the conclusion that when teachers assign projects on which students must work together, the students learn much more effictively than they are asked to work alone on projects.	B_C1
The reason is that group study can help students have a big picture in woring decrition, but also promote students become versitle.	E_C1
 
As a old saying goes: mistake is the best teacher, which means making mistakes is a necessary part in the process of growing up.	S_I0
It is common for young people to make mistakes even though it may hurt them.	S_T0
As far as I am concerned, when upbringing their children, parents should allow their children to make mistakes, which would benefit their lives.	S_T1
Making a mistake is a unavoidable part of our daily lives, which makes us upset and confusing.	S_M1
On the other hand, it sometimes teach children how to deal with the problems that they have to solve rather than just turn others for help or copy someone eles.	B_S0
There are two reasons to comform this opinion.	I_S0
First of all, making a mistake gives child the ablity and courage to face the problem.	I_S0
For example, the first time when I learnt how to ride bick, I was too scared to move if my father didn't hold it.	I_S0
I asked my father for help again and again, thus making no progress on the skill of riding.	I_S0
As a result, my father told me to ride my own and experence the feelings by myself, even though I may hurt in the process of riding.	I_S0
After tens of fall down, I finally learned how to ride a bick and how to face with the problems individually.	E_S0
What is more, making mistakes would help children to gain experences and the courage to face with dilemma.	S_M1
If a child rely too much on his parents, he would never know how to solve the problem and it is hard to build his confidence, which would give them a lot of trouble after they step to the society.	B_S0
Taking a real story as an example, a college student pakaged all his dirty clothes to his home just because he don't know how to watch them.	I_S0
His parents spoiled thier child and never give a chance for him to make mistake, making him to be a people who can not handle everthing.	E_S0
All in all, the mistake may make children dispirited over a period of time, but it will teach them how to solve the proble and build thier confidence later.	S_C2
 
I agree with the following statement.	S_T0
Firstly，I think we have to help struggling strangers.	S_M0
Maybe he is a old men ，maybe she is a student or just a child.	B_S0
Everyone will have a lot of problems in thier life.	I_S0
You might don't know who is them，but，you can help them what you can do.	E_S0
When you take the bus，you might see a women lost her money.	S_M0
You can help her，like just give her one dollar to take the bus.	B_S0
When you go to the mark，you might see a child can not find his parent.	I_S0
You can help this child，take him find his mom.	I_S0
When you go to the park ，you might see a men sit on the ground.	I_S0
Looks like drunk.	I_S0
You can just buy water give to him.	E_S0
Help others is not hard ，is not need you save the world.	S_M0
It is not very hard things，and this thing is very easy.	B_S0
Everyone all can do it.	I_S0
And I think，if people learned how to help struggling strangers.	I_S0
This world will be better.	E_S0
You might have a very hard problem sometimes.	S_M0
You might want to go to die.	B_S0
Because you think this world have nobody care of you.	I_S0
When this time，if have a stanger comes told you ：‘’this world is beautiful，and you have friends and parents.	I_S0
If not ，we can become friends.	I_S0
And then give water to you.	I_S0
Then，you might have a power for your life.	E_S0
This is a very easy thing.	S_M0
But the struggling stranger do not think so.	B_S0
You might save them life.	I_S0
At least, you helped them.	I_S0
And this will make your happy ,too.	E_S0
So,I think this is a very important statement.	B_C1
Everyone should help others.	E_C1
 
As the saying goes like this,"partens should let children make mistakes and let them learn from thire own miatakes".	B_T1
The statement is confroming us that children who make mistakes is not a bad thing,they can learn experience from it, only when all exeriences add up ,that will led to success.	E_T1
There are many reasons accountable for the statement ,on the one hand,when the children made mistakes in the problems,they will avoid making it again and they will have deeply understand with the problems ,so  they will do it better in the next time.	S_M1
On the other hand ,while they are failed to achieve their goals,they also learned much practical experience ,these experience is much important than reputation,take the Ebglish learners for example,if one is fear open his mouth to make mistakes,they will never learn oral ENGLISH well,Last but not least ,mistakes can make people have more courage to do things they like.	B_S1
They will not fear about  the similar things.	E_S1
Frome what has been discussed above ,it is important for children to make mistakes,then they will learn fresh experience from mistakes ,only when all experiences add up can many mistakes turn to success.	S_M1
Therefore,parents should let children make mistakes and not fear about it.	S_S2
 
I think it is not a good idea for parents to offer their school-age children money for each high grade that they get in school.	B_T0
First of all, although what we learn in school is of great significance, but there are many things that are as important as what we learn in school.	E_T0
Therefore, giving children a reward indicates that only high mark is important, which will mislead their children to study only.	B_T1
As a result, they will miss many chances of learning extre knowledge and experiencing meaningful activities.	I_T1
The most terrible consequse of this is that their children may fail to develop important traits such as humor, kindness and so on.	E_T1
What's more, any person have its own talents.	S_M0
It is of great possiblity that they don't good at school courses such as maths, languages or physic.	B_S0
Rather than this subjects, they may have a gift at cooking, sprots or other things.	I_S0
So, it is important to think carefully about what you children good at and what they liked.	I_S0
Just focusing on high grade may let them not only lose confidence and lislike learning, but also ignore their talents and value.	E_S0
Thirdly, such behaviour will encourage dishonesty.	S_M0
If you children wanted to get more pocket money but were unwilling to study hard, they would cheat in the exam.	B_S1
Instead, taking part in your children's study and concertrating on developing good behaviors and habits are more effective and beneficial.	E_S1
The last but not the least, rewarding for high grade may give your children a false impression that they study for money.	S_M0
In fact, you need to let them know that they not only work for themslves, but also work for the human beings, or our social will become too cold to survive.	S_S2
In conclusion.	B_C0
focusing on your children's gifts, habits,traits are more meaningful.	I_C0
And company and care is more warmful than money.	E_C0
 
I think this is a good with 2 reasons.	S_T0
First, parents give their children money becuase they get good grade, this actiobn is fine beacuse it can encoureage their children to get high grade to earn money, and the only way that children earn money is spend more effort on their class and on their homework, they need to study hard to get good grade, so that their parents can give them money.	S_M1
Nowadays, more adn more people become richer than before, they pay more attention on their children studying, they can buy new pens, new schoolbags and many things they want for them to encourage them to study hard, but actually, this way is not good enough, however, give children money when they get good grade can encourage them study hard in a good way, because they can realize the money is hard to earn so they may not waste money, and they can buy what they want by themselves, it can also help them to learn that sometimes people need to accept ir reject, because their money is limited, so if they want to buy the things they like, they need to study harder to get better grades and get more money.	S_S2
Second, all the children in this century will ask their parents pocket money, some parents give them the money without any condition, this will enable the children become wasteful because they can get money without doing anything, it's unfair.	S_M1
But if parents don't give them pocket money, they may have some problems when they do some mistakes hust like don't have enough money to take the bus.	B_S1
One of the way to give them money with some conditions is give them money when they get good grades, it can help them to know that if you want money, you need to work, adn the children can have money to do the things they like, this way is kill two birds with one stone.	E_S1
That's why i think this is a good idea.	S_S2
 
As the step of the mordern life is becoming faster and faster, young people nowdays argue that their time is less and less, occupied by the amount of study or works.	S_I0
Although it is true that young people are always too busy to finish the job which have business to them, I have to say that helping their communities is important experience in their life for the reason that it help young people to become more enthusiatic with the social works and young people will gain some social experience during the process of the work.	S_T1
Firstly, it is everyone's duty to help building a perfect enviroment of the communities and the importance of  young people spedning their time on helping is well-know.	S_M1
If  all of the young man take the limitaion of time as excuse, without contributing to the communities, the communities will break off.	B_S0
To illustrea, my roommate, who is a person having no responsibility to the work of communities, argued that he had no time to care about the communities, and even led many friends of him to stop the work of helping communities.	I_S0
So the communities of them become worse and worse, and finally, he gave up the contratiction because even he could not bear the bad enviroment.	E_S0
Secondly, the social experience will be gained by the young people who are doing the communities' job.	S_M1
During the process of work, young people will learn how to cooperate with their workmate and know how to overcome the difficulties meeting in the work.	B_S0
For example, I attended a communities' work when I was ten years old.	I_S0
I was so young that I did not know how cooperate with my friend, trying to finish work  by myself, and absolutely, resulting the bad work.	I_S0
However, gradually I knew how to rely on my friend who could solve the problem brothering me, and I also can help him to solve the problem he met.	I_S0
I firstly taste the benefit of the cooperation.	E_S0
It is true that young people are always have so many things to do that they have no attention on communities' work.	B_C0
However, without helping the communities' work, young people will only when they get into the social work can they know many experience, leading many hard work for them to solve.	I_C0
What's more, the communicaties is everyone's duty to do.	I_C0
Therefore, young people are supposed to finish work of the communities.	E_C0
 
It is education that parents pay more attention to with the development of the society.	B_I0
There are some parents tend to offer their children some money for each high grade they get in school.	I_I0
Some people contend that this way to facilitate children's grade has passive influence on the studying attitude of students.	E_I0
From my perspective, however, it is a wise way to encourage students to learn the knowledge more efficiently.	S_T0
Fisrt of all, getting money which parents offer children for high grade provide students with a great oppotunity to buy something they will use in study.	S_M1
Furthermore, children would like to learn some financial management skills in the practice rather than only learn it at the class.	B_S0
For example, when I was 9, I got the best grade in my class.	I_S0
And my parents would like to award me for the good performance.	I_S0
Then, I got 50 dollars and buy some science book and a mp4 for listening english.	I_S0
Through that measure, I learn to how to use money reasonablely.	E_S0
Secondly, it is a good choice for children to spend some money on entertainment.	S_M1
Because they have some studying pressure, so the money they gain from their grades is necessary for them to relieve their pressure.	B_S1
For example, I get other 50 dollars to paly.	E_S1
And I can keep on pursuing better performance for long time	O
 
should the student be gotten reward for their high mark?	S_I0
Nowdays, there is a saying that " the real danger is not the students begin to study hard to get the money, but the real danger is that the purpose of study starts to become for money".	S_T1
The purpose of the saying is to show us that the most importance should be attached to the meaning of study.	S_T0
I do not think is a good way ,offering children money for their high grade, which is changed the meaning of studying.	S_M1
To begin with, an attitude of study could be the base of getting a good mark.	B_S0
Money can only leads children to study how to earn the money, and it obeys the meaning of the edcation.	I_S0
In addtion, studying for innovation and creativity is what we should respect, as we konw, innovation is from study.	I_S0
For instance,it was only after ten years and three difference of varying tries business model that an enterpreneur ,Jcak Ma,finally found success, and went to become the chairmen of one of the largest Internet companies, Alibaba.	I_S0
His sucess comes from his innovation and cretivty ,which was trained during his education experience.	I_S0
If someone only get the score for money, he will never get the inspiration of creativity.	E_S0
To sum up, in any field of study, it seems necessary to first put emphasis on the meaning of study itself before one can finally get a sucess in that field.	S_M1
It is as if god is testing us,testing our purpose to see if we are really dedicated to our dream, before god finally rewards us with sucess.	S_S2
Money can not replace the meaning of study and the endevor	O
 
It is a generally accepted fact that there is no better way to set up the cornerstone for the children's future achievement than giving their children better education.	S_I0
Obviously, with the society develop, parents nowadays have more intention to involve in their children's education.	S_T1
In the first place, in order to face the increasingly competition in the society, parents need to attend in their children's education to enable their children become more competing edge.	S_M1
For instance, as informative period advance, whatever consider any job opportunity, to be mastery of a second foreign language is the neccesarry ingredient of work.	B_S0
The reason is that only if people have more languge ability, they can attain more coorperation with foreign companies in this international period.	I_S0
This way, the increasing number of parents take their children to take language courses and accopany them to study.	I_S0
It is known to all that this phenomenon was impossible in the past.	I_S0
Therefore, the increasing requrement in this competing society make parents are welling to involve in their children's education.	E_S0
In the second place, recently parents have more time than the people did in the past owing to phenomenon that parents nowadays have fewer children than the past, which makes parents have more time to accompany their children can help them on education.	S_M1
My family can successfully illustrate this opinion.	B_S0
My mother have two brother and two sister; therefore, my grandmother could only distribute little time on each children and she need to earn more money to take care of these children when they were young.	I_S0
This common phenomenon make parents in the past can not spend lots of time on their children's education.	I_S0
Nevertheless, I am the only child in my family.	I_S0
Therefore, my mother have not large budget on family and she have more time to spend attention on my education.	I_S0
This condition makes her always take me to courses and check my homework of different discipines.	I_S0
Therefore, the different family condition between current period and past time makes our parents can have more time to involved in children's education.	E_S0
Furthermore, nowadays people's totally different perspectives from past make parents need to be more involved in their children's education.	B_C0
In the past, people hold fast to the tradition that children were supposed to follow their parents career, which made parents need not spend much attention on their children's education because their can just teach their children their work experience.	I_C0
Nevertheless, this tradition is extinct and children nowadays prefer following their own idea.	I_C0
Therefore, parents need to spend more time to learn their children's opinion and to think about how to help them such as taking the course and attending the labs.	I_C0
Therefore, totally different tradition betwine current society and past time make parents need to involve their children's education.	E_C0
 
It maybe isn't a good idea for those kids's future.	S_I0
Because it gave them a habitant that everything they excellently done worths a award.	S_T1
But actually,many things we've done doesn't gave back a feedback instantaneously.	B_S0
Just like study,it takes time to parctice it until you reach a very high level.	I_S0
It is very different from receive some money after youget a high mark or grade in school.	I_S0
For example,it is impossible for a person who even doesn't know the letter of English to recite a few words for a few days and then expected him to speak a fluent English.	I_S0
But the worst thing is,if someone had the opinion about whatever I did worths a reward,then when he faces some big problems in the future,those really hard questions that you need to research a lot of material and to think very hard then may ger a result.	I_S0
He may give up even the process wasn't done more than a half.	I_S0
Because everything you do can't receive an instantaneous feedback.	I_S0
And the period of the process was much longer than he expected.	I_S0
And it cause a factor that efforts him to give up it finally.	I_S0
So it is very important for us to remember,what you've done or studied is not for the money our parents may offers to us.	I_S0
But is for ourselves.	I_S0
To have a better future when you become a grown-up.	I_S0
You can do whatever you want if you have enough time and wealth.	I_S0
You can then enjoy but using the time now to study until you reach your dream,although it is very hard for us.	I_S0
Only a tiy amount of people can get a final results that better than others on the way studying.	I_S0
So my opinion is, don't use money to encourage the kids to do better on study,you may think it's king for them,but it exactly can ruin one's whole life!	E_S0
 
I agree with the statement that people are more willing to help the people they don't quite familar with.	B_T0
In the following, I will give several reasons accompanied with the examples to support my argument.	E_T0
To began with, the education today is more developed.	S_M1
In the school, student are not only teached how to learn the knowledge but also the neccesary to be a good people to the society.	B_S0
As is often the case, we are required to learn to help others in difficuty, which means that we should have the pity or synthpony for the people.	I_S0
That is the basic qualities that we should have.	I_S0
So, in my view, with the development of  the education, with the level improvment, most of us have the sense to help us, even the people is just a stanger to us.	E_S0
secondly, the enviroment is better and better.	S_M1
If we look around or have a scanning on the news, it would not de difficult for us to find that there are many examples which show the reality that people are more willing to help others.	B_S0
For example, several days ago, I read a news that says a teacher give up her life to protect her student.	I_S0
After reading the news, I was very shocked.	I_S0
The behavior to using one's life to protect the children is worth our respect, which also shows that people are willing to help others.	E_S0
In the end, just as the saying goes, helping others is also helping yourself.	B_C0
Everyone would have a period when he was trapped in touble and need others help.	I_C0
And at present, with the development of teconology, helping others is more easily.	I_C0
We can just use a mail or something else to help others, and it would make lose something.	I_C0
The instincive nature of human is good, and this may be a reason for huuman's willing to help others.	E_C0
 
Nowadays many parents choose to reward their children with money for their improvements in grades.	B_I0
Pesonally,I do not think this is a good idea.	I_I0
The advantages are easy to be seen:when children receive money from their parents,most children wiill be cheered by the money,as money is what most children want to get.	I_I0
Besides,children will be happy to study hard in the next period of time,becasue the reward is imaginary.	E_I0
Thus parents can achieve their goal:make their children to study hard continously.	S_T0
Unlike the realizeble advantages,the disadvantages can hide at first and work in the long run.	S_M2
What if the children get full marks?	B_S0
How should the parents give them a reasonable pride?	I_S0
Once parents fail to meet their children's requirments,what will chiildren think?	I_S0
Just like a vacanoe,everytime you award your children,you add something to the vocanoe,when you could not fulfill it,it will erupt sometime.	I_S0
This can cause rather bad results,no one would want to undertake.	E_S0
In my opion,it is right to award chiildren as long as we use a good mothod.	S_C2
When comes to award children properly,money is not a good idea,while some phycological reward,for example,spending a full day with children,would work better.	B_S0
School-age children usually can not care theirselves well,if we give them more than they could manage,it will not does any good to them.	I_S0
In fact, to teach children how to live rather than give what you can give is what parents should do.	I_S0
Compard to money,there are many other good ways parents can use to award their children.	E_S0
 
Nowadays more and more people pay attention to occupation issues.	B_I0
Is it more important relating well to people than studying hard in school for being successful in a future job?	E_I0
In my opinion, I agree with that wo should be able to relate well to surrounding people.	S_T0
There are two advantages supporting my ideas:making group more effective and united and attracting more clients.	S_T1
Admittly, studying hard is vital.	S_M1
Because the harder we study, the better we master our knowledge in major.	B_S1
With the good grades, you will be offered more job chances,which means you can find the job you can success easily.	E_S1
Nonetheless, relating well can make your group more effective and united.	S_M1
Sometimes when your group is choosing the theme of projects,your group members may have different ideas and argue with others.	B_S0
If you get along well with group members,people will convince your choices.	I_S0
Therefore your group will be effective and united.	I_S0
For example, when I was in intership,I always brought my colleagues soft drinks and snacks.	I_S0
So everyone liked being friends with me.	I_S0
Once choosing theme of presatation,I put forward my idea while others were arguing.	I_S0
Then everyone make a decision to accept my idea.	I_S0
Finally,we prepared our presatation very well because of save much time.	E_S0
Also, relating well to others gets more clients.	B_C1
When you are doing your job,it's so significant to communicate with your customers or clients.	E_C1
If you treat them	O
 
I agree with this statement.	B_T1
In the past, young people depended too much on thier parents to make some important things to them.	I_T1
In my opinion, I think is not good to depend to much on our parents.	I_T1
In the past, the old China, the young people can't decision their own love.	E_T1
In the most case, that is depends on their parents to chioce a person that they like and feel good.	B_S0
And they will never feel what's your feel.	I_S0
The most thing that I hate is we don't know each other.	I_S0
Then we go toghter and married.	I_S0
We don't know what he like or dislike.	I_S0
We don't know everything about the other one.	I_S0
But now, I think it's  most different from the old time.	I_S0
In this time, when we grow up, we can decision our love.	I_S0
And now, parents is just giving some advises to you.	I_S0
And they think if that love is good for you, and they will agree with you.	I_S0
Then, in the past, your parents will make a plan about you life when you grow up.	I_S0
when you finish your class, they will tell you have after class in the weekend.	I_S0
And they never feel your feel.	I_S0
And think about your feel.	I_S0
They just use the way that they think is better to you.	I_S0
But now is different, too.	I_S0
Give an example, from my childhood to now, my parents never told me what should I do.	I_S0
They alwanys ask me what should they do.	I_S0
And the after class is depend on me.	I_S0
If I think my grace is not good, and I need help.	I_S0
I will talk to my parents I need have the lessions after class.	I_S0
And my parents will give me many time to spend or do something I like.	I_S0
So when I was young, I make some hobby, such as play basketball and read books and so on.	I_S0
It make me more health and make me strang.	I_S0
So,I depend things by myself.	I_S0
In one hand, it make me indelepent.	I_S0
On the other hand, it help me spend a happy child age.	E_S0
So that's why I agree with these statement.	B_C1
We have more chance, it all depend on ourselves.	E_C1
 
Nowadays, people begin to pay an increasing attention to the surrounding enviroment of our daily.	S_I0
And the government tries to attract more visitors by increasing the policemen's number or improving the appearance of our surrounding.	S_T1
Some people think that improving the safety may be helpful.	B_T0
However, in my point of view, changing our environment is more effective.	E_T0
To begin with, making improvements in our surrounding can get more attention from the society, thus attracting more viewers.	S_M1
To make the surroundings more beautiful, the government will post some signals and hold some exhibitions and  lectures about it to call on more citizens  to participate in it.	B_S0
Therefore, more and more people will get to know about the city then visitors will come naturely.	I_S0
To illustrate, my hometown used to untidy in the streets and have a poor environment.	I_S0
But last year the government started to improve the surroundings by posing some advertisements on the television which encouraged people to claen the rubbish in the streets.	I_S0
Consequently, more people got to know about my hometown and the tourists number increased greatly.	E_S0
Moreover, improving the appearance of a city is more cheaper than hiring the security guard.	S_M1
It is quite expensive to hire professional security police, but if you choose to improving the surroundings the government just need to pay for some fees to clean the rubbish.	S_S2
Imagine that hiring a p	O
 
Nowadays, education is the most important things in modern society for every family.	S_I0
Many parents consider how to help their children acquire enough grow from body and mental.	B_T1
A part of parents think they sould let children make mistakes and let them learn from their own mistakes.	E_T1
As for me, I believe it is a great way to help chiildren grow more quickly.	S_T0
First of all, children make mistakes can learn people should responsible for their speaking and behavior by oneself.	S_M0
For a child, if he do some bad things, he must be know he should disappeared his thing make some bad influence.	B_S0
In my childhood, I used to hurt my friend David, I think he is so bad for make paper boat, then I crsis he is stupid.	I_S0
He is so angry I crsis it, and then he did not talking with me two days.	I_S0
I actualy know I hurt him, so at last I apologized for him and say sorry.	E_S0
He forgave me and I would never poke fun at others.	S_S2
In addition, when children make some mistakes and change it, he will have profound indepression in his mind.	S_M0
For example, when a child make noise in some quite place, other people will remind hm, when he listen this remind.	B_S1
He does not want to have second mistake in same solution.	E_S1
Admittedly, children do something will acqire some worse result.	S_M0
They will iminate many very bad thing, such as smoking and hurt the other one.	B_S0
However, parents can make some rule and use some ways to prevent more bad things influence their children.	I_S0
In a kind place to allow children make mistakes and learn from their own mistakes.	I_S0
In fact, learning from children's own mistakes have benefits.	E_S0
In conclusion, children should acquire more experience in their mistakes, it can help their mor	O
 
As far as this problem is concerned , i think it is better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise .	S_T1
Because When we are tired , we need a quite enviroment to regulate our mind.	B_S0
So at this time ,we need some activitys which are gentle.	I_S0
We could read a book under the sunshine , we could watch a interesting movie with our best friend .	I_S0
But on the other hand ,we could not completely take negative to the physical exercise .	I_S0
Some physical exercise encourage the team work , which is better than being alone .	I_S0
For example , especially our young people ,when we choose physical exercise we always go to choose like basketball or football.	I_S0
In these sports , people play as a team ,share their happy thing and achieve a mission .	I_S0
At this time we could take higher enjoyment .	I_S0
By contrast , if we just read book or watch tv, we couldn't take effect.	I_S0
So , in my opinion we should find a way to balance this two way .	I_S0
Only to complet this thing that we could take health body and happy everyday .	E_S0
 
There is an old saying in China says "if you want to see more things, you should go higer", that means only keep working in new things can make a preson more successful.	B_T0
So most of successful people tend to try new things and take risks instead of doing the things that they are good at.	E_T0
Trying new things can make people do better in the fields that they alrady know a lot.	S_M1
We all know that many fields are linkes to each other, if a man keep learning new things, he may find something new in the fields that he good at.	B_S0
For example, Lin Yutang, the famous Chinese writer and expert of language, was interested in typewriter when he was old.	I_S0
He spent a lot of time to learn how the typerwriter workd and wanted to make a new typewriter that can type Chinese words.	I_S0
He tried to learn many new skills that he even noy heared of before.	I_S0
Finally, his new typewriter was finished.	I_S0
And to his surprised, he found himself had more knowledges of language because he had to learn many things about how to type words in different kinds of languges.	I_S0
So trying a totally new things make Lin a even more successful writer.	E_S0
On the other hand, a successful always need knowledge in more than one fields.	S_M1
Just like a saying says "eggs  should place in different places rather than a sinlge place".	B_S0
People should try as much new things  as thay can if they want to be successful.	I_S0
For example, most of the famous people are good at many different fields.	I_S0
Just like Newton, one of the most famous sceniceists in the world, was an expert in physical, astronomy and even in theology.	I_S0
And in China, a good writer always required to have knowedge in history.	I_S0
For instance, Shu Dongpo could write down all the history book from memory.	I_S0
And it is very for us to think about a succeccful person who is only good at a single field, without trying new things a person can not get knowledge in new field.	E_S0
So people should keep trying new things and take risks, that will make us easier to be succ	S_C2
 
Recently, a hot topic arouse attention among students; are the rules that societes today expect young people to follow and obey too strict?	B_I0
The answers vary from one person to another.	I_I0
In my opinion, i think the rules now is actually suitable to the students due to some element that would really bad to the students, the strict ruels would let students keep away from that, in other hand, those ruals could contribute on students grade and their future.	E_I0
To start with, in this international age, there are abundant potential threat which would harm to studnets in the internet.	S_M1
In that condition, some rules about the internet would inssure that young students do not involve some negative net  for them in the net.	B_S0
For example, there are a lot of ruels to limite young students in the net.	I_S0
such as some bloody game would force you to tell the rally age of you, and just allow the adult to play due to the bloody picture that the video game reveal would impress the students, even result in the inmitation of them.	I_S0
We could see this is a case of ruels that designed for teeneagers, it would protect them and very sitable for their groth.	E_S0
Additionally, some rules that students regard it as strict could improve their grade, and at least in China, the grade in the school is one of the most essential things for students' future.	S_M1
For instance, every high schools in China would present some policy in school, such as do not allow high school sdudents to smoke, to eat the unheathy food or fight with others.	B_S1
These kinds of ruels is totally strict, if a sdudent violate any ruels in the campus, he or she would face to be expeled from the school; however, all of this rules are benefit for students' grade, it would let them focus on study instead of other things, so it is actually reasonable for the students.	E_S1
Actually, the people who think the ruels that society give to students is too strict to afford holds their reasons.	S_C2
One of the reasons is that the ruels would pressure the students; however it is worth saying that, the both  the school and the internet is a part of society, and keep students with good habit in the society is totally important.	S_S2
 
Nowadays, as many labor work could be finished by robots other than human, people are pursuing convenience in their own work.	B_I0
Some would choose to work longer for several days and have more free days while others would consider working less hours per day but more days at work would be better.	E_I0
There is not a definite anwaer to this question, however, as far as I am concerned, I would say that working more days per week but less working hours per day can have more benefits.	S_T1
First, working less a day is better for work efficiency.	S_M0
When talking about a task, people would surely think about its efficiency because efficiency is an crucial representative of the work.	B_S0
The higher efficiency you have, the more wonderful your result will be.	I_S0
And here comes to the work problem.	I_S0
Since there are many researches on how work time affects the work efficiency, it is not hard to find that too much time focusing on one thing would definitely lower the efficiency rather than promote it.	I_S0
So when people work for hours per day, they may find themselves not than doing anything useful in the extra time comparing to shorter hours per day work schedule.	I_S0
And I feel that when I study.	I_S0
I used to think that if I study for 12 hours a day then I can improve my grade quickly.	I_S0
But the results turned to be irony as my test scores were even lower after several weeks 'assiduous' work.	I_S0
Then I realized when I spent so much time on one thing, I would feel tired soon and gradually lose my efficiency, which led to my degradation in the test.	I_S0
So from my own example, it is not a wise choie to work too long per day.	E_S0
What is more, working more days a week can assist the workers in forming a better work habit.	S_M0
It is knwon to all that when people do the same thing again and again, they would form a habit, which can improve their performance in turn.	B_S0
And working is like that, if you spend five out of seven days on working, you would be more accustomed to the work and thus lead to a more proficient work behavior.	I_S0
This is also very important when talking about work performance.	I_S0
Still, I can give a example of myself.	I_S0
When I was doing a part time job in a restaurant last summer.	I_S0
I first worked for 4 days a week and then 5 days a week.	I_S0
When I worked for 5 days per week, I found that I can handle the trivial things better than I used to be, even some skills which were newly introduced.	I_S0
Then I figured it out that it was the extra day made the whole difference.	I_S0
By working one more day a week, I can get to know more about the work and practice my skills more often in a short period time.	I_S0
From this view, working more days per week can benefit staffs by improving their proficiency and flunency, or in other words, helps them bulid a familiar pattern of their work.	E_S0
Admittedly, working 3 days per week has some advantages as it can provides the staffs more free days and they can do some huge activity like go on a long trip with their family or even hold parties with their friends all night long.	S_M0
However, when taking job performance into consideration, these amusing things should be set apart as people could not lead a happy life unless they accompish their own tasks well.	B_S1
So if people want to have a more fantastic life in the future, it is better to work more days and try to form a habit of working instead of spending the time for amusement more.	E_S1
To sum up, working 5 days a week is prior to working 3 days a week as it can boost work efficiency and help the staffs build a more promising road for the future career and life, which is everyone's hope.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, with the development of society , in the companies and universities have more chance to through a meeting to solve the problem.	S_I0
when the teacher or the leader says something incorrect in your opinion, some people will say nothing.	B_T0
And others believes that should  immediately interrupt and correct the mistake right away.	E_T0
As for me l will wait until the class or meeting is finish and the people are gone, and then talk to the teacher or meeting leade, and my reason wiil be analyzed in the following paragraphs.	S_T1
First of all, l think after the class to find teacher to talk about my opnion is best way, because the teacher has more experince than student.	S_M2
By this way, it can respect the teacher and also l can share my opinion.	B_S0
By contrast, if who immediately  interrupt the teacher, which is very disrespectful to teathers .	I_S0
And may my opinion is not very well which may diturb others opinion.	I_S0
so i think afher class is over and people are gone to talk with the teacher is best way.	E_S0
Second,	S_S2
 
I disgree with the idea that watching a movie or reading a book is more relaxing than physical exercise.	B_S0
We are in a time of Internet and infomation,which maybe have a highly request on thinking and processing information.	I_S0
so wen it comes to the word'exhausted',it equals to the meaning that we are tired in mind or having a headach.	I_S0
As for reading and watching a movie , that ,the same process of geting tired,the goal of access to relax may not be easy to accomplish.	I_S0
Physcial exercise , on the other hand ,pushing the blood to your limbs instead of your head ,in the mean time ,we are getting rid of beng bothered or being tempted by the noise in our head ,as well, after physical exercise ,the  following physical tired feeling can contribute to a sweet dream  .	I_S0
And a sweet dream help us to recharge.	E_S0
When wo read or watch a movie ,wo recieve information from our eyes unavoidable,and our brain has to deal with these stuff, from my perpective ,it certainly not be a good experience.	S_M2
We may be compealed or impreased by the story in the book or the movie in the mood at the time ,but in fact we are getting more tired in the process.	B_S1
Out of the idea ,I insist thatwo should take physical exercise as a wiser choice to relax.	E_S1
 
Nowadays, how to educate children better is very popular from person to person.	B_I0
recently, there is a related issue about whether parents offer their children money when they get a good grade is highly debated.	I_I0
Some people think study hard and attain a high scores are fundamental tasks to students, while others hold that parents giving the approriate  reward is make sense and reasonable.	I_I0
From my part of view, I support the later point.	E_I0
There are several explanations and examples in following paragraphs.	S_T1
To start with, I think offering the money as a good reward can stimulate children to study hard continually.	S_M2
There is no denying thing that each child hopes that having more pocket money to buy something they like.	B_S0
Taking myself as a example, once I obtained a excellent academic performance in the school, which made my dad felt delightful and pride, thus, he increase my pocket money money and told me that my money would be increase again only if  I can get a process in the next test.	I_S0
Thererfore, I am willing to study more diligently everyday and got a excellent scores in the final exam.	E_S0
Another benefit of giving children money as a reward can indirectly help them to cultivate a positive gabit of managing money.	B_C1
It is undoubtely that children will save their moneyto buy some objects that dealing with emergency.	E_C1
For instance, my freind often save  her scholarship and buy the parents when her families or freind's birthday	O
 
With the remarkable progress of people's living standard, people can choose their life style flexibly.	B_T1
working only three days a week for long hours and working five days a week for shorter hours  are two ways for employees to arrange their time.	I_T1
Undoubtely, the three-days work offer many advantages over five-days work.	I_T1
Convenience is the biggest advantage.	I_T1
Notwithsdanding, there are still many people chooing usual five-days work, I am one of them.	I_T1
because the five-days work can be more regular and efficient .	E_T1
Firstly, work five days a week is a regular way to work with certain rationlity.	S_M2
Generally, we have to get up early if we have job that day.	B_S1
And it will be accustomed to have a healthy circle.	E_S1
 
In this day and age, a controversial topic has aroused a  heated deabte among people whether people will use less time to cook and preoarung food in twenty years than they  do today.	B_I0
Opinion vary from person to person.	I_I0
Some people claim that people will not reduce their time to cook in the future.	E_I0
However, contrary to these people's opinion is my perspective that  it is in twenty years that people will use less time to cook and  prepare food.	S_T0
My points will be elaborate as follow.	S_T1
To begin with, it is lacking of money that makes people to reduce their time to cook and  prepare food.	S_M1
Because with development of  society, people have more financial pressusre, which needs them to earn more money.	B_S0
The more time they spend on cooking, the less time they can use to make money.	I_S0
Take my father as an example.	I_S0
When was a young boy, he used to cook delicious food for me.	I_S0
However, after the 2008 financial crisis, he does not have time to cook for me.	I_S0
Becasue he had to make more money to support our family, like paying my tuition and providing health care.	E_S0
What is equally worth discussing is that people need more time  to improve themselves ranther than cook and prepare food.	S_M1
Because  with increasing of competition, people has to learn more  useful skills to facilitate them to get more chances to purchase a better career in the future.	B_S0
Take myself as an example.	I_S0
At the begining of working, i cooked every day.	I_S0
However, two years later, my supervisor told me that i need to learn some computer skills, which is very useful for rencent market.	I_S0
Gradually, i used more and more time to learn different skills including english, business class and counting.	I_S0
Finally, i did not cook anymore.	E_S0
in conclusion i am convinced that people will have less time to cook and prepare food.	B_C1
Beacuse they need more time to enhance their ability and earn more money.	E_C1
 
How would you feel when you get involved in making more and more money and sacrifice your time playing computer games like PUBG with your friends during your spare time?	B_I0
How would you feel when a bad emotion affects your working efficiency since you haven't seen your children for quite a long time and being fired by the boss in the end?	I_I0
All above are associated with jobs that require employees to leave their family and friends.	I_I0
From my perspective, I prefer jobs that allow employees to stay with their family and friends although the salary maybe lower.	E_I0
For one thing, the goal of high salary is not making more money but ensuring you a happy life that you can enjoy yourself.	S_M2
It makes no sense to get higher and higher salary without the companion of our family and friends.	B_S0
For example, if a person who works in a large international company and get well paid often asked by the boss to fly to other countries to trade with merchants there, he can hardly have time to stay with his family and friends all year around.	I_S0
Although he has a lot of money, he can't get joy out of it for the goal of making money is misled.	I_S0
Owing to the fact that everyone tends to live a pleasant life, it is much better to choose a job that allow employees to leave with their family and friends regradless of the salary.	E_S0
For another, being depressed by the emotion of leaving their family and friends for a long time may results in being fired.	B_C1
Most of people will be greatly affected by seperating from people they care for a long period, they may feel loney and hopleless.	E_C1
On the contrary, for instance, if a person with a lower salary can stay with their family and friends, he will stay optimistic for he knows that what he is doing is all for his family.	B_S0
Furthermore, he is going to work harder in his job to ensure his family a greater life.	I_S0
Gradually, his boss may see his endeavour and raise his salary to inspire him.	I_S0
Although the salary is low at the beginning, one can do best in his own job and get promoted later, and thus earn high salary as well as get chances to stay with family and friends.	E_S0
 
Nowadays, the trust between people are considered more valuable.	S_I0
Trust is a basic bridge connecting people.	B_T1
But, there are also some people would like to tell white lies.	I_T1
Some lies maybe extremely troublesome to our personal wellbing, while white lies maybe more innocuous.	E_T1
In my opinion ,  I think we will not always tell truth in any people.	S_T0
To begin with, if we always tell truth in front any people, there might some bad impacts instead of letting people know truths.	S_M1
For intance, when students in physics class, there are doing a examination to test the force od friction.	B_S0
After all the teacher does the examination, some studens find the results are different with what thess students do.	I_S0
These students directly point out the error of the teacher makes.	I_S0
The teacher feels very ambarrassed.	I_S0
Since that thing happen there are many students do not trust teacher anymore.	I_S0
Through this story, always telling turth might contribute some bad efforts.	E_S0
Furthermore, sometimes white lies might be better for people to accept.	S_M1
For intance, there was a mstudent who is living in school at ordinary time.	B_S0
One day, there is a bad thing happen, her mom is kidnnaped by criminals, and after ciminals rob, they directly kill her mom.	I_S0
But, after that thing happens, the girl's father does not tell her truth.	I_S0
Her father says her mom dead in accident during the traveling.	I_S0
This white lie might be better result for the girl.	I_S0
If his fatehr tells truth, she will leave a shadow in her heart for rest of her life.	E_S0
In the end, do not telling truth sometimes can let relationships between friends better.	B_C0
If there are some conflicts and opinions between friends.	I_C0
If people tell their opnions to their friends, they might not be friends anymore.	I_C0
But, if when they have conflict, they care about each other, do not tell turth , they still can be friend.	E_C0
 
I hold the opposite view of offer children money for high grade.	S_I0
Though money may give study power instantly, it may cause bad influences latter.	S_T0
Money can surely encourage children to study hard in some content.	S_M0
We all konw that money can do lots of things meeting our human desires.	S_S2
However ,this may lead children study for tests but not for acquiring konwledge.	S_M0
Children come to school to study konwledge, which may benefit them not only in the tests but also in their further life.	B_S0
So it's their first aim to acquiring knowledge rather than getting test skills.	I_S0
When children study for high scores, it's certainly they will aim to the test cores and negelect other things as important.	E_S0
Besides , offering money for high marks makes bad influence on children's moeny.	S_M0
As children are always told works worth salary.	B_S1
But study is definitely not work but task.	E_S1
Why should doing what is supposed to do	O
 
In such a competitive a society, people today face with massive pressure and have less time to relax.	B_I0
When asked about the schedule of working, some desire longer weeknds with longer working hours in weekdays, on the contrary, others hold the view that despite of shorter weekends, shorter time of working is way more acceptable.	I_I0
From my perspective, i prefer work only three days a week for more working hours instead of having a job where I work five days a week for shorter  hours.	E_I0
I am going to support my standpoint with the following reasons.	S_T0
First and foremost, longer weekends help people relax better and in return work more efficiently.	S_M1
After a week's heavy work, people must be tired both in physical and mental.	B_S0
They need more time to release their stress and refresh their mind which could help them perform betterat work in return.	I_S0
Take the company near my house for example.	I_S0
people there work on three or four days a week but they could manage to solve everything in time and in order though they might do extra work at night.	I_S0
And,  in the weekends, they could do anything they like such as hiking or traveling.	I_S0
Because of enough relaxation they get from longer weekends, the hard work in others' eyes seems not unacceptable and they have more energy to pay to their assignments.	I_S0
Longer weekends brings more rest and more rest help people do a better performance at work.	E_S0
On top of that, people could spend more time with their family.	S_M1
Nowadays, an increasing number of people choose to work away from their parents which miakes it hard for them to visit their parents.	B_S0
I, myself is a point in case.	I_S0
I am working in another city far away from the city which my parents live in.	I_S0
So, I cannot visit them every week.	I_S0
And what makes the situation worse is that I have to so some extra work now and then.	I_S0
If I own a longer weekend, this problem could be handled easily.	I_S0
That is to say, longer weekends could provide a better family atmosphere.	E_S0
Admittedly, working longerhours everyday does do harm to people's health and may attach more pressure to them, notwithstanding, through the better rest from longer weekends, these troubles could be overcome easily.	S_S2
Take all the factors I discussed above into account, it is wise to draw the conclusion that the advantages of working longer per day with longer weekends outweigh the disadvantages.	B_C1
And I strongly believe more and more people would like to live such a lifestyle in the future.	E_C1
 
I strongly agree with the opinion that it's better to relax by watching a movie or reading a book than relax by doing physical exercise.	B_I0
Frist of all,physical exercise can only relax our body but not mental.	I_I0
Contary watching a movie or reading a book not only can relax our body but also our mental.	I_I0
So I prefer watching movie.	E_I0
Oh,It's can also open up our eyesight.	S_T1
Secondly,physical exercise is so boring that we can't insist on for so long.	S_M1
But reading books or watching movies is interisting it also can give us the energy to face th problem ,make us know more about many other cultures and so on.	B_S1
So I definitely agree with that.	E_S1
Futhermore ,the most important reason I agree it is that when we watching movies we can improve our spoken English,when we reading books we can learn the skills to how to write.	S_M1
In a word we can learn a lot of skills ,knowledge while we are relaxing.	B_S0
It helps us so much.	I_S0
It's right that we should do some exercise,but it's not for relaxing only for keeping us in health.	E_S0
From what has been talk about above I turely suggest that we'd better relax ourslves by reading books or watching movies.	S_C2
 
Some people in society think that in twenty years from now, printed book used by students will be eliminated.	B_T1
However, I have a different idea.	I_T1
When it comes to the statement that students will continue to utilize printed books in twenty years from now, I strongly agree.	I_T1
There are some reasons why I feel this way: there is no suitable thing to replace printed books, and printed books is easy to protect the eyesight To begin with, now, we can not find a good substitutes for printed books, because electronic books is not popular in some poor area.	E_T1
In Cina even all around the world,many families can not afford the price of electrnic books, they even need to worry about their food resource.	B_S0
For them, electronic books is too expensive to pay.	I_S0
Therefore, it is impossible that students will give up printed books.	E_S0
In addition, it is harmful for students to stare the screen for a long time.	S_M2
We all know that the slight yello paper	O
 
I disagree it is better to relax by watch ing a movie or reading a book than reax by doing physica lexercise.	B_T1
That is because physical exercise can exercise body to make people get a good sleep and get a great hobit when you relax, also can get some friend when you play some team sports like soccer or basketball.	E_T1
At the frist, physical exercise can exerise body.	S_M1
After you work for whole week, you maybe will feel your neck and your showder is very uncounfutable.	B_S1
So at this time , you can try to do some sports like running, your just need to run about 30 min like 3 or 4 kilometer, then back to home, take a great sleep, at next day morning, when you wake up, you wil feel your body is very ralex,and you also can use this way to lesset weight.	E_S1
Second, physical exerise can make you get a good hobit.	S_M1
that is because people allways work at monday to friday, and ralexed at weekend, so if you keep phy	O
 
Many parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade they get in school.	B_I0
This thing causes a lot of disscussion.	E_I0
Different people have different opinion.	B_T0
I think this is not a good idea.	E_T0
There is no doubt that offering their school-age children money for each high grade can encourage children to study hard.	S_M2
But many children may study hard only for money and ignore the real meaning of learning.	B_S0
But children should understand that studying hard is not for money but for knowledge.	I_S0
I afarid that some children may copy others in exam to get high grade.	I_S0
We should try our best to help children to realize the fact that studying is to enrich soul and build up our own bright future.	I_S0
Only by realizing this fact, children can study hard whether there is reward or not and study harder.	E_S0
I think we can give reward, but we'd better not give money.	S_C2
As we all know,financial skills are important, but money can also corrode people's heart s.We can give them some other things such as books to reward high grade to make them know that having high grade is honour but not for money.	S_S2
 
As far as I'm concened,  there is no doubt that people today are more willing to help the struggling strangers.	B_T1
We have just came across a period of time,when almost everyong tried to avoided their socail responsibility.	E_T1
For example, the XiaoYueYue incident happened in Guangdong, in which case a little girl crashed into a car and  seriously injured but the people passed by just ignored her.	B_S0
And the new that a man who gived a helping hand to a old woman was blame for the woman's injuredalso strike us.	I_S0
All these thing are damage the willing of us to help others.	I_S0
But it did remind us that the importance to protect the people who are willig to offer their help.	E_S0
As a result ,the grovenment are now encourage people to help other by setting up some laws.	S_M2
Besides, there are a lot of people show us a model.	B_S1
During the acident happened in Hubei, a soilder named GuanDong gave his equipment to a survier trapped in the ship,risking the dan	E_S1
 
Nowadays, students all want to have a effectively working method, so that they can finish their work and have time to do mroe.	B_I0
So, whether students need work together or learn alone on projects is more effectively become a popular debate.	E_I0
I support students work together is more effectively.	S_T1
First, students can solve the problems by themselve with firends helping.	S_M0
this mothod can save you time also can help increasing your grade.	B_S1
For example, if  one student can't understand one question even he check the book and his note, before he asked teacher he can ask help from his classmates maybe he can solve this problem, and this student can also check if his classmate is really understand this question not have ant problems for it.	E_S1
Second, students sovle questions together it's mean he can can have same number of teachers, a student can have a class  to his classmates if he is good at this subject.	S_M0
This method can help classmates to undersand konwledge also can help this theacher student because if he wants to teach clearly and correct he must make sure he was more correctly and clearly.	B_S0
To illustrate one student is good at math he can teach his classmates again after class if his classmates are not clearly understand the konwledge.	I_S0
For this this student maybe will has more questions on this part and solve it to make himself improve.	E_S0
Finally, students work together can help teacher be relaxed and save the teacher's time to prepare mroe helpful project or more useful PPT in the class.	S_M0
For example, students solve problems by themselve and theacher has mre time to prepare a reaction for chemistry in class to showed, it can make students more interested in chemistry also can help them know more clearly in the knowledge.	S_S2
All in all, these all of my opinion of why students should work together and more effectively, it can help both of students and teachers.	B_C1
Teacher need to try it and enjoy it.	E_C1
 
When it comes to the topic, I think it is a good idea for parents to offer thire children mony depended on thire grade.	B_I0
My advice is outlined below.	I_I0
First of all, there is no denying that such rewards is kind of encouragement, which is likely to effectively motivate children when they want to have a game time.	E_I0
More interest can be inspired when children prefer playing rather than studying, thus helping them improve unconsiously.	S_T1
What is more, such rewards are apparent evidence showing the preference of parents.	S_M1
As children commomly hope for parents' appreciation, through this way, they know one way to live up to their parents, thus making them attach great importance to their subjects.	B_S1
They will do better and better not only for the money but also for the love from parents.	E_S1
Last bu not least, it provide a great way for parents and chirldren to communicate.	S_M1
As is well-known to us all, many parents are too busy to take care of their family, let alone picking time to talk with their children especially if there is not necessary.	B_S0
However, giving money to chidren is a great way for parents to know how theire children develop recently.	I_S0
They are 'forced' to know the study progress of their children, and they may have a joyful communication while giving the money.	I_S0
In a word, it contributes to improve the relationship between parents and children.	E_S0
All in all, giving money to children after they get a good mark is a good way for children.	S_C2
 
I guess this view are always shown in school：one person watch another student's homework and remember the answer, then quickly fill in his own paper and hand in the book to their teacher.	B_I0
This is not  uncommon in nowadays school, more and mroe students are likely to spend a litte time asking other students for answer and spend the rest of the time which should be used in doing their homeworks playing other things, so the topic gives us three ways in order to stop this kind of  cheating activity, and in my opinion, I think the third way is the best way to prevent these activities.	E_I0
Here are my reason.	S_T1
First, even the school increase the penalty or punishment to the students who cheat on homework assighment, the students will just ignore it and keep on cheating, because they are more willing to use the time in playing, not in studying, though they have to pay for it.	S_M1
For example, in 18th th US publish a law called the 'drinking prohibition ‘， however，after ten years there are more bars in the countryside, and the crime statistics keeping increasing  becaause people can't control their desiring of drinking, so they do the drinking bussinesses underground, more and more bars were increasing, and more and more violance because of the resources competition.	B_S1
So, the same reason, this opinion won't stop the homework cheating.	E_S1
Second, asking parents  to help monitor their children is also won't working out.	S_M1
Because, even if parents  can make sure that their children cannot cheating on their homework, for some parents that have a very hard work on the day, and they need to relax themselves in the nigh	S_S2
 
A Good Heart To Lean On	S_S2
Today, we can found that many people are more willing to help struggling strangers.	B_T0
I really agree with it.	I_T0
As following is my reason for why I think it is right.	E_T0
Frist of all, the quality of life is become better.	S_M1
Therefore, we have not to think about the difficult in our life.	B_S0
We have more opptunities to help others.	I_S0
So when we come across to struggling strangers such as beggers, we feel sorry for them then we may help them.	I_S0
Furthermore, most of us have an idea of that we are better when we help others.	I_S0
As a result, after helping others, we feel great about ourselves.	I_S0
It's a useful way to improve our characters.	I_S0
Last but not least, sometimes, helping others may help us in the  future.	I_S0
There is a very popular story, a big cup of milk.	I_S0
One day, there was a very poor boy.	I_S0
He beg everyday.	I_S0
Once he came to a girl's house, he asked for a cup of water.	I_S0
However, the beautiful girl gave him a big cup of milk.	I_S0
The boy was moved and remembered the girls's name.	I_S0
Several years later, the girl got a very sever disease.	I_S0
She had come to many hospital but no one can cure her.	I_S0
She came to the last hospital in the town desperatly.	I_S0
Most of docters thought the girl is going to die while only a young doctor insist to help her who is the boy.	I_S0
The operation was successful and that the girl survived.	I_S0
Unfortunatly, such a big operation must cost a lot of money that the gial can't afford.	I_S0
To her surpise, when she look at bill, the onlyis a big cup of milk.	I_S0
We didn't know what is about to happen.	I_S0
So help others may help us one day!	E_S0
In a word, there is no disadtantage in help struggling strangers.	S_M1
Even it's a really good thing to help them.	B_S0
So why not?	I_S0
For these reasons, more and more people are willing to help struggling strangers.	I_S0
As an old saying goes" the roses in her mind, the favor in mine".	E_S0
 
With the advancement of the society, modern people's life is filled with various kinds of informations andentertainments, life is no longer as simple as the old days.	B_I0
So, there is no surprise that people turn to be satisfied with many different types of tasks to do during the workday rather than just do one thing all day long.	E_I0
There are following reasons I want to state to support my point of view.	S_T0
First of all,doing some different tasks can learn much more knowledge and skills than do the similar task.	S_M0
When do the task we are not familiar with, we need to search for the relevant information about the topic, thus our storage of knowledge can be extended and our ability to read will be improved.	B_S0
Besides, presentation tasks improve our expressing skills.	I_S0
After that we become much more knowledable and capable by doing different kinds of tasks which may contribute to our success in the career.	E_S0
Secondly, different tasks help us make many friends.	S_M0
Since these may exist in different fields, we need to get along with people professional indifferent fields.	B_S0
By talking to them,we can not only get the reference we need, but also become good friends with them.	I_S0
With the relationship, our life could be more colorful and embrace plenty of joy.	E_S0
Finally, it is more effficient to do more than just one work a day.	S_M0
Poeple who are asked to do one single work all day long definitely feel dull and they tend to lose focus.	B_S0
By contrast, when assigned variety kinds of tasks, their mind shift quickly and can concentrate on work for a long period of time.	I_S0
Only in this way can the company get more work down without longer working time.	I_S0
Workers will be more pleased with it.	E_S0
All in all, workers are more satisfied to do many kinds of	S_C2
 
Nowadays,facing pressures of urban life,many parents offer their school-age childen money just for high grade they get in school.	S_I0
Money sometimes makes its,but it doesn't do good to children's overall development.	S_T0
First on the children's site,money award makes learning an extremely physical thing.	S_M0
They will just study for some money,but not the original joys on knowing more knowlege.	B_S1
Dipping a sip of the happiness of getting money that way definately do harm to their growth,maybe they will be indifferent about something valuable but without money pay.	E_S1
Second for those parents,such thing maybe allienate them between their beloved chidren.	S_M0
It's widely accepeted that money ties are the most fragile connections.	B_S0
Imagining one day,the chilren just communicate with them for money.	I_S0
What a horrible thing!	E_S0
Third at the standing of the society,money connections is necessary but never taught in this way.	S_M0
Children are the future of  all nations.	B_S0
In spite of the short-term of money award ,such behavior makes the children world's formula the wrong way.	I_S0
Innocent thinking on studies should not be poluted with all money payback.	I_S0
The more focued on learning lifelong and concentratedly,the more florished the nation is.	E_S0
Above all three angles of the social phenominom,I've got many authoritic books and views to cite.	S_M0
Finland,the best educator,makes learning a happy thing away from money and jobs.	B_S1
American educators also advocates that we should just activicate the children's intrest and always purify the enviornment they live.	E_S1
In conclusion,of course my answer to this question is NO.	B_C1
I really want to see a futu	E_C1
 
There a famous saying in ancient China "Two heaads are better than one", it means that teamwork is important than lonly work.	S_I0
In such a competitive society, people are all paying attention in their children's education, so they may foucus on the childrens working during the class, some parents may know taht their kids is a leader of a study group, other parents may know taht their childden like to study alone, so they may feel uncertain: wroking together and learning alone, which one of them is more effectively.	B_T1
However, in my opinion,I agree with the first statement because I think working together is a more effective way to learn a projects.	E_T1
Firstly, working togetheer can help students find their weaknesses.	S_M2
As everyone know, if a children can't get a good grade, they may have some weaknesses that could not been sovled quickly, and usually they can not find their weaknesses on their own ability.	B_S1
However, if a boy discribing his problems and sharing his own solution to other students, others may think the solution scrupulously, and if the solution have some mistakes, the boy could know his weakness and make sure he won't make the same mistake in the next test, so working together have a more effect than studying alone.

Secondly, studying in a group can solve many difficult problems that are much harder than the normal problems.	B_C1
When learning a project, we will usually face many difficult problems, if we are not very smart, and we can't sovle the problems alone, we can asking some friend and creating a smaal group, so you can concentrate all the wisdom into your problem, this way is not only a much efficiency way, but also a useful way that could help you sovle many problems that are very difficult, Otherwides, working alone also have a few questions.

The problem of offering moneyto children is that if this child is crazy about computer games or fringe novles, they may use the money to spoil their lives and the money.	B_T1
However, parents can ask the children o make a list about what he or she is going to do to deal with the money to avoid worse impacton the children.	E_T1
Firstly, offering money leads to a positive motivation and encouragement to children to study harder.	S_M1
If a child makes up mind to achieve the goal and is envious to get the money, he or she will be definitely full of energy and pays more effort to study.	B_S1
In this way, the child will not only get the prize, but also the sense of achievement and pride which pushes them to work harder in the future days.	E_S1
Secondly, offering money provides those aspirant and self-descipiled children a convenient and fast way to buy more resoureces which entitled them to learn more.	S_M1
For example, books like bibilography or extra exercises are essential to someone who is ambitious to be in the top of the rank.	B_S1
That will spikingly be an efficient way to help children plan their future study and reach their goals.	E_S1
 
To be honest, it is foolish to think our mankind will change as the economic grow.	S_T1
And it is quite arrogant to think yourself as a better person than people in old days.	B_S0
In fact, when we live in peaceful or normal life, most people who are educated by the socity would be glad to offer a hand for strangers.	I_S0
But when we are having a war or in a hard time, I think it would be quite normal that most of people choose to stand aside in silence.	I_S0
Because helping others will require resouces, if you can't guarantee your own living, how could you offer your hands to others?	I_S0
The reason that people are more willing to help the strangers is just because that we are living in a luckly time.	I_S0
Those charity or fundation we build in today's life.	I_S0
How could  people enjoy such convention in old time, like world war 2 or some time else?	I_S0
Enjoying the option were gaven by our ancestors, we choose to laugh them instead of thanking them?	I_S0
I can't agree with such statement.	E_S0
 
At present, a contraversial topic has aroused a heated debate among people: whether the government should improve the safety by hiring more police in order to attact tourists.	B_I0
Opinions vary from one to another.	I_I0
Some people the claim that it is unnecessary to hire more police.	E_I0
However, contrary to their views comes to my own perspective that the official should make some imprivement on the safety by doing so to attarct visitors.	S_T0
My view is based on the following points.	S_T1
First, adding more police could have a straightforward effect on terrifying the bad guys.	S_M1
To be more specific, if there is a lot of police in one of the places of interest, it can play a role in visually threatening those bad guys who want to destroy the public safety.	B_S0
Thus, it could prevent some terrorists from the origin by the easiest way----increaing the number of police.	I_S0
However, if there are only a couple of police present, some terrirists have the capacity of fighting against such small number of the police.	I_S0
The results would be quite serious because robbery, even the riots would happen and the safety of the visitors could not be guaranteed certainly.	I_S0
For example, Tian'anmen Square is one of the most famous place in China and there are always many police patroling in the square.	I_S0
And there  are usually some people who want  parade or riots to destroy the public order.	I_S0
Due to these great number of police there, no one would do such bad things easily.	E_S0
Second, employing more police could make visitors feel internally secure.	S_M1
That is ,  on seeing the police, the tourists will feel  very relieved because they don't need to worry about their security anymore and they could focus on the tours rather than feel scary about their lives.	B_S0
However, if there is a little police in some places, the visitors even don't want to go there because their basic life safety would not be guaranteed.	I_S0
For example, Yunnan province is located at  the border of China  with beautiful scenery but only few people are prone to go there for there exists a serious safety problem and the policeman are quite scarce.	I_S0
If more and more police were added to the local place, there might be more visitors going there.	E_S0
In conclusionm in order to attract visitors, government should improve the safety by hiring more police not only	S_C2
 
Have you ever heard about some old stories from your grandpa?	B_I0
They always told me that they had a very hard life when they were young.	I_I0
However, some say they even can not find a suitable job to sustain their life, because the competition is very intensive now.	I_I0
In my percepective, I totally oppose this statement.	I_I0
Because the people in the past were harder to find a place to get money than current adults.	E_I0
I will illustrate my points below this paragraph.	S_T1
To begin with, there were numerous wars in the past which can absolutely prevent the people to maintain a full family.	S_M0
Lots of wars can destroy the large company to develop, then even you have full of knowledge, there is no way for you to gain money.	B_S0
To take my grandfather as an example, he used to go a WuHan college, a famous university at that time, to study mathmetic.	I_S0
Everyone in his villege thought that he would have a great job in the future.	I_S0
Nevertheless, after he graduated, most of the large companys were destroied by Janpanes.	I_S0
Thus, he had no way to get money to sustain a normal life.	I_S0
So, it was more difficult to live than now.	E_S0
As we all know, with high techniqu development, many convienient objects has invented fornow.	S_M0
Such as telephone, subway, computers and cars, wich are all can play a crucial role in our live and can save our time or make the life more comfortable.	B_S0
For instence, there is no need for us to send a letter to a long distance, which will cost plenty of time and money consuming.	I_S0
Now, we just need to click our screen then talk with our relatives, even they are living in the foriegn.	E_S0
Although, some think that nowadays the chemical pollution can harm our living, which was not exsitive in the past.	S_M0
Nevertheless, we also have many super merchine for us to detect such material.	B_S1
At last, it can not make an impact for us.	E_S1
Finally	S_S2
 
Time is changing,the way parents teach their chidren also have to make some changes.	B_I0
In the past age of material shortage,parents have no idea to reward children.	E_I0
As far as i am concerned,it is negative for chidren that they gain motivation by beening given money.	S_T0
I am really against that parents give money to their kids in order to encourage thay to study hard.	S_T1
First, encourage is not wrong itself.	S_M1
However,when money is involved the meaning has been badly changed.	B_S0
when parents reward children for each high mark this action will suggest children that I make effects for money not knowledge.	I_S0
Seriously ,learing is students' respensiblities ,something they must do.	I_S0
This twistied idea will lead those immature kids who just lack the ability of controlling  to a wrong road in learn period.	E_S0
Second,rewarding  kids has a danger,which is if you give them too much reward and too much a value for what they do they will denigrate this activity.	S_M1
It will form their false philosophy and axiology.	B_S0
The information conveyed to them is that only for money.	I_S0
In the long run, ir will really have a bad influence on kids' .	E_S0
Then, personally,another way to reward a child is togive him privileges or special gifts when he accompalishes certain appointments.	B_C1
Changing the way to reward can also reflect on the moti	E_C1
 
I totally agree the statement, and we all should know how to relate to people when we finish a job that boss give us.	S_T0
It's of great importance.	S_T1
First of all, doing a job isn't like doing homework.	S_M1
When we are in the school, we can get good grades just by our own strength.	B_S0
If you work hard enough, you can get you work done perfectly.	I_S0
But it's totally different in the work, the socieity is not a school.	I_S0
You can't just rely on a single person's power.	I_S0
You need to have a good idea of how to make good use of the power of a group or a team.	I_S0
For example, if someone has to finish a project, can he just work hard but not ask anyone else for help?	I_S0
Since he can't take good control of the whole thing, he need others to finish a part for him.	E_S0
Secondary, as we all can see, the information is something that is the most important in today's work.	S_M1
We can't finish work perfecyly without enough useful information.	B_S0
And this is the time we need to relate to others.	I_S0
Take Wallstreet for an example, the information is particularly useful for the economic workers.	I_S0
If a person who relstes to others well, he can foreast if the stocks will value more by using the information that others provide to him.	I_S0
And then let's have a look at a person who have no idea how to relate to others well.	I_S0
Under this condition, he will never have the knowledge what is the next step that economic may take.	I_S0
That is the difference.	E_S0
Lastly, lt is undoubted that hard work matters a lot in the work.	B_C0
And the benefit that it may cause can't be denied.	I_C0
But working is not as easy as studying.	I_C0
Only studying isn't enough.	E_C0
You need to relate to others so that you can go further,	O
 
Accompanying with the fast development of the society, is the complexity of the modern life.	B_I0
More and more people are under great pressure that they sometimes do not know how to deal with their's lives even.	E_I0
Based ton this situation, I totally agree thatit is neccessary for the young generations to learn how to plan and organize.	B_T0
I will give my reasons in the following paragrahs.	E_T0
Since modern life is getting more and more complex, we have to deal with things in a short period of time, this requires us to have the ability to plan our own schedule and organize things.	S_M0
That is the main require we have to get into the society.	B_S0
Just think about it, one day working in the office and asked to prepare for some important event, if we can not react immediately, how can we performance great, or how can we work at a high efficiency?	I_S0
We'll need to learn how to plan and organize then.	I_S0
These abilities help us performance well when we are in the face of different situations so that we can get into the society.	E_S0
Learning how to plan and organize makes us a better person.	S_M0
As we become someone who is marvelous at planning and organizing, it means that we are able to take our responsibility to ourselves , individuals around us, and even the wotld.	B_S0
In this case, we become stronger and more responsible, it is kind of a symbol of grown up.	I_S0
We will be regarded as people who is capable, who is reliable, then we are going to face more different kinds of stuff,which will difinitely lead us to be the best ourselves.	E_S0
We have to use these abilities to deal with different situations so we will not get into trouble.	S_M0
The more complex the modern life is, it means that the world itself are facing a lot of problems created by the increasing population.	B_S0
These problems are everywhere, they will show up in several patterns, and I can say that they are mostly harmful to the society.	I_S0
They are destroying our world, and if we can not plan and organize ourselves well, we may be burried into these problems, due to the fact that to solve these problems require that we shoule haventhe capacity of dealing with hard situations, and this kind of capacity is absolutely based on the ability to plan and organize.	E_S0
To conclude, it is really essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize, because it plays an neccessary role in our social activities, personal goals and daily situations.	S_C2
 
Nowadays many parents would like to have a perfect child.	S_I0
In order to do that, they may do not whant the child to make any mistakes.	B_T0
However, there are many people thinks that it is totally wrong and hold the opinion that this kind of action will spoil the child.	E_T0
From my prespective, I reckon that parents should let children make mistakes and leat them learn from it.	S_T1
To begin with, it is necessary for children to have the ability of learning from their own mistakes.	S_M0
The children are going to grow up one day and the parents will leave them.	B_S0
At that time, no one can protect them.	I_S0
In the situation, the ability of discovering and concluding form their own mistakes is becoming such an essential thing.	I_S0
As a good example, my friend, was not a child who did not allow to make mistakes.	I_S0
In contrast, her parents thought that making mistakes will help her develop the skills of learning.	I_S0
Consequently, whe she graduated from school, she is able to absorb some experience from her mistakes and the skill is useful for her career.	I_S0
As the example suggests, the ability of learning from mistakes is indispensible for a person, which can only be praticed from making mistakes.	E_S0
Secondly, learning from mistakes could leave a deeper memory for the children and let them not make the mistake again.	S_M0
In contrast, if the parents do not offer the children a chance to make a single mistake, they will forget it quickly.	B_S0
Next time, the will trapped in the same dilemma.	I_S0
For example, my classmate is not allowed to make mistakes.	I_S0
Before he is going to have a mistake his parents would tell him not to do that.	I_S0
As a consequence, he often forget the mistakes he have made and then do that again.	I_S0
Had his parents let him to make mistakes, he would not have been the person who often forget the mistake.	E_S0
There is no denying that parents are not supposed to let their child makes mistakes provides some benifits.	S_M0
To be more specific, it can HELP THEIR CHILDREN BECOME A PERFECT PERSON which is good for gaining of the confidence.	B_S0
Nevertheless, the best side can not last long because if the child have a mistake, he or she does not know what to do next because they are not allowed to make mistakes.	I_S0
As a result, they will become upset and lose confidence, which is a negative effect on the child.	E_S0
To sum up, parents should let their children to make mistakes cause it is not only optimistic for the ability of learning form their own mistakes but also benificial for the remembering of the mistakes which is capable for the children not to make the mistakes again.	S_C2
 
Frankly speaking, I don't agree with the statement.	B_I0
First,I think physical exercise do more good to our health than relaxing by watching a movie or reading a book.	I_I0
As the saying goes:Body is the base of evething.	I_I0
While doing exercise,not only can we gain happiness but also wo can build up our body.	I_I0
However,when you watch a movie ,you just sit there and keep still just wathing the screen.	I_I0
The same as reading a book,your eye will be tired after reading  a long period.	E_I0
Both will do harm to your health untill you use proper way to realx your body.	S_T1
Second,physical exercise can give you more opportunity to communite with your friends when you do it and relacx together.	S_M1
You can use body touch as well as words to improve your friendship.	B_S0
You can also watch movie with your friends too which is more romantic,but communication during the process will just disturb the atmosohere and communication will be lacked.	I_S0
What' more,you and your friends can share  the progress that you has made to encourage each other .	I_S0
Little progress will also let you feel a huge sence of achievement.	E_S0
In addition ,physical exercise can help you lose obesity while relaxing.	S_M1
After a day' hard  work, your will be tired out and may choose eat large amounts of food  to release your stress.	B_S0
Actually,it is not a good way.	I_S0
Yoo will just put your self to the way of gaining weight.	I_S0
Why not to choose exercise to relax yourself,when sweats dribble down your neck,your fat is burned and your stress can also be released through large amount of ecercise.	I_S0
In the end ,you will gain a charming body bot pounds of fat and you also relax yourself.	I_S0
It's juat a two win to do exercise.	E_S0
In conclusion,Relax by doing exercise has lots of advantages than reding books or watching movie.	S_C2
 
I agree with the second view.	S_T0
Access to so much information creates problems.	S_T1
At first, the information on Internet are not always real.	S_M1
As we know, the cost of anyone to do a presentation on the Internet is very low, anyone can easily register in any website and say what he/she wants to say.	B_S0
That leads to the low authenticity of the information.	I_S0
Even the big Internet Industry will leave the false information in the Internet.	I_S0
When people learn the fake information and get use of it, something wrong might happen.	I_S0
In China, Baidu is a big Internet industry, but Baidu leave many false medical information and high evaluation of hospital which give money to Baidu, but the hospital can not deal with your ill indeed, many patients are the victims of it.	E_S0
The second, the value of the information is also an important thing.	S_M1
The traditional information soures, such as books, information from that way may be examine and only valuable information can remain to now.	B_S0
But the information on the Internet is often not valuable but it can also remain for a long time.	I_S0
For example, if you want to know something about your paper, talking with your teather may be more efficient then finding solution from the Internet.	E_S0
And then, the information on the Internet is a mess, when you really want to find some certain knowlege, you will distinguish it from a lot of other information, this is not efficient.	B_C1
For example, if you really want to know how to sing, I suggest you to join a singing class.	E_C1
 
Rewarding school-age children with money is not a good decision.	B_T1
so I don't think it is a good idea.	I_T1
Using money to encourage children will let them develop bad values.	I_T1
When you first reward them by using money,you may not think it is going to affect the kids.	I_T1
But the first time a child receives money for this,they take it for granted.	E_T1
They will think that if they do it right,they will be rewarded with award or even money.	B_S0
Such values are very repugnant nowadays.	I_S0
If I Have a child with such a valve,I will be upset and regret for my educating.	I_S0
So don't reward kids with money.	I_S0
If it is necessary,I would buy some toys or candy to praise them.	E_S0
Another reason is that using money to reward kids will	O
 
Thether watching a movie ot reading a book is more relaxed than doing pysical exercise is a controversial problem.	S_T1
After considering on my own conditions, I decide to  draw the conclusion that I disagree with the statement that it is better to relax by watching or reading a book than doing physical exercise.	S_T0
First of all, one wants to relax is for the face that he or she is bored with the repeated life-style.	S_M1
So doing something different is the best way of relaxing.	B_S0
Nowsday, we are working or reading everyday, but doing pyhsical exercise little.	I_S0
Never in any era, did the stake involving realizing the sense of exercise outside has be more important than now.	I_S0
Considering its good to our body, exercise must be the best choice for us to relax.	E_S0
In addition, watching or reading is the spirtual-only activities.	S_M1
But while doing pysical exercise, we should not only use our mind and body, but also the talent of the control and the judge.	B_S1
After a long-term exercise, one is likely to be tired with any energy, and his or her inner motion must be of great happiness.	E_S1
As I showed above, doing pysical exercise is a greater relaxation than watching and reading for it .	S_C2
We can have the access to watch a movie or read a book easily, but doing exercise outside irregular.	B_S1
So  pysical exercise is  the best choice to relax;	E_S1
 
Nowadays, so many parents want to choose a good career for their children.	B_I0
There is a question apeared, whether in the past it was easier to indentify what type of career or job would lead to a secure, successful future.	E_I0
Some people agree with that, some people disagree it.	S_T0
For me, I prefer latter.	S_T1
First and foremost, a successful future depends on whether the people are hardworking.	S_M1
To be more specific, whatever the career is, if the person are hard working, he will be very successful.	B_S0
For example, my friend Jack found a job last year.	I_S0
he is a game designer and it is a very popular career for now.	I_S0
Although he got a very popular job, he still workhard very day.	I_S0
When his partner take rest, he was thinking for a new game.	I_S0
After one month, he designed a very interesting game and got the boss's attention.	I_S0
After that, his future became brightness.	I_S0
If he had not worked so hard, he should not had been a successful person.	E_S0
On top of that, there are so many popular career, in the past, extined now.	S_M1
This is primarily because the evolution of tecnology too fast.	B_S0
Rober can totally replace people to finish that work.	I_S0
Thus, if some people choose those career in the past, they will have nothing to do today.	I_S0
As a result, we cannot identify what type of career or job can lead to a secure and successful future.	E_S0
To sum up, it hard to identify which type of career can help us sucssed in the past.	B_C1
We do hardworking lead us a secure and successful future.	E_C1
 
Nowday the number of students get a lot of money when they get in the school , they might have their own reason for that, however , the most of the students also still get normal pock money when they get in the school.	S_I0
well , i think the pock money is more suitable for scool age childern ,beacuse most of the school age students don't kown how to use large amount of money and the other one is there might have compaciso psychology bteewn same age kinds .	S_T1
Firstly, the school age students that are unsuitable to use a lage amount of money ,since they don't have concept for how to use it , not olny they will sink money by buy some useless thing, but also they might do something breake the pattern,for instans, my father friends is a rich man , so he always give his son a lot of money to use , he think if his son feels happy ,no might how much money is, howere  his son always use his money to buy the	O
 
I do not think some parents offer their children money fer each high grade they get in school is a good idear.	S_T1
There three reasons I will show you.	S_T0
Firstly,If parents give their children money when they get good grade all the time.	B_T1
They will conform a habit that I study just  for gaining money .	E_T1
But this reason is eactly not the reason why we should study.	S_T0
Secondly,this method which stimulate children to get good grade by using money can not make children have a correct thinking of money.	S_M1
They will think only I study verry verry hard I can obtain what I really want.	B_S1
But in taday's generation,the gainning of metiria is not only rely on study,the way we achieve our dreams more and more rely on our imaguantions.	E_S1
Thirdly,this way may help children learn a reaaly bad habit .	S_M1
That is cheating.	B_S0
In my school life I usually saw my classmates get good grades by cheating teachers .	I_S0
They use mobile phone and other things can obtain the answer of tests.	E_S0
Offering money to children for getting good grades will hurt your children .	B_C1
Don't do that.	E_C1
 
There are many things to consider how to spend the time when parents are not around us.	S_T0
Different people hold different ideas about that.	B_I0
Some people think playing games or sports is a perfect way, while others are firmly convinced that doing things related to schoolwork is a better choice.	E_I0
From my perspective, I think the second way has lots of benefits.	S_T0
First of all, finishing schoolwork when parents are away can spare more time to spend with them.	S_M1
A lot of students in China have tons of schoolwork to do, as a result of which, they have little time to play with parents.	B_S0
However, students can finish their schoolwork as soon as possible in order to have fun with their parents when they get home regardless of the busy work.	I_S0
For example, if a student have fun playing games when he is alone, he may have to do his schoolwork when his parents get home after a whole day hard work.	I_S0
He can't spend time with them for he has to submit the work to his teacher or he will be punished by the teacher and his parents.	I_S0
So this is a perfect way to make full use of time to finish schoolwork as well as spending time with parents.	E_S0
Secondly, studying more and getting higher grade will definitely make parents happy.	S_M1
All parents in the world hope their children to have a better future, so they concentrate on their children's performance in school very much.	B_S0
If a child study very hard everytime his parents are not at home, his grade may rise a lot.	I_S0
Hearing child perform better at school, his parents will be delighted and may probably buy him a gift he wants for a long time.	I_S0
This is much better than just playing games or sports when parents are at work.	E_S0
Last but not least, playing sports alone may result in injury.	B_C0
It is a quiet dangerous circumstance when playing sports with no one around.	I_C0
For children are too young to decide what to do after getting hurt.	E_C0
They may start crying sitting on the ground and the wound may be affected.	B_S0
It may result in serious healthy problem.	E_S0
Besides, getting hurt for one time without parents around may cause a physical problem.	S_C0
He may be scared to go outside without parents,	S_S0
 
Recently, a topic has aroused a heated debate: which factor influences you the most when you are making a major purchasing?	B_I0
Some people think that inforamtion from media leads their selection, other think that salesman in the market plays the most important role on their decisions.	E_I0
However, I think recommendations from my friends of colleagues are of great significance.	S_T1
To begin with, it cannot be denied that information from media can help us make choices when buying goods, but it is not the most important.	S_M0
With the development of the media and commerce, advertisement becomes one of the main approaches to let people know a commodity.	B_S0
The companies that produce the commodities usually exaggerate their products to attract more consumers in their advertisements, and these advertisements usually cannot convince customers.	I_S0
For example, I bought a bag of washing powder because I saw its advertise on TV, and I believed that its efficiency of washing dirty clothes is high.	I_S0
However, when I used it to wash my dirty shirt, I could not clean my shirt even a little, so I became not believe in the information from media since then.	E_S0
Moreover, the salesmen in the market can sometimes help us make our choices on purchasing goods, yet they might not be convinced always.	S_M0
Salesmen usually have not used the products they are selling themselves, and they do not know the exact quality of the products.	B_S1
All they want is usually their bonus after they sell the goods, and they are not responsible for selling a bad-quality commodity.	E_S1
Nevertheless, recommnedations from friends and colleagues are usually the most helpful for us when it comes to a major purchase.	S_M0
Friends and colleagues are the persons that we can trust, and they have already used or experienced the products, and their feelings are can lead us to make choices.	B_S1
For instance, I bought a computer under	E_S1
From what has been mentioned above, we can draw a conclusion that although information from media and salesman in the market are somtimes attractive, recommendations from friends and colleagues can truely benefit us when we are deciding to make a major purchase.	S_C2
 
Whether or not identifying a promising job is easier in the past is an debated topic.	S_I0
While some people may feel that it's easier for people in the past to identify what type of job could lead to a secure and successful future because the categories of jobs are more complicated today than the past, I don't think it's the case.	B_T0
I strongly believe that with higher technology and higher education level, it's a piece of cake of today's people to identify what type of job is promising.	E_T0
Have you ever heard of the notion 'Big Data'?	S_M1
I believe most of us hear or see it everyday.	B_S0
With the fast development of technology, data colletion is an increasingly easier job which can help us identify each kind of job with datas.	I_S0
For example, if the definition of a job's success is the money one can earn, then the agency could collect the money data of large quantities of workers in every career to get the average salary of each kind of job.	I_S0
By comparison, we will be aware that which kind of job is promising because the data will never cheat us.	I_S0
Nonetheless, we could never know clearly which job could be more prolific in the past because the only thing we could do is to consult those people around us about their salaries and those could be random, not convincing.	E_S0
On top of that, education level is also averagely higher today than past, which enables us to know from a young age that success doesn't necessarily mean money.	S_M1
I still remember a sentence said in the movie 'Kungfu Panda'.	B_S0
It goes like this' What suits you most is what's best for you.'  which means we should find what we are good at in order to succeed rather than persue those with average higher income blindly.	I_S0
And this idea is instructed through our education trace, which wasn't the case in the pase.	E_S0
 
In the past, people like to help others because they think it is meaningful.	S_I0
But now, people are  not willing to others because it is a risky activity and people will not get reward.	S_T0
Generally speaking, people will not hurt the man who provides help to him.	S_M2
However, there is a kind of people who make use of other's kindness and make money.	B_S0
Pengci is a typical activity.	I_S0
People pretent to fall down on the road and wait to be helped by others.	I_S0
When others help them to stand up, they say they are pull down by the warmful man and they pursuit a compensation from them.	I_S0
Hence, helping others is a risky activity because it brings trouble to the kind man.	I_S0
Besides helping the strangers has a high risk, people do not get reward from it.	I_S0
Helping others is a voluntury activity.	I_S0
People can not get money.	I_S0
If people plan to help the strangers, they will spend a lot of their time and money.	I_S0
People can use this time and money to do what they want to do rather than help others.	E_S0
We should encourage people to help pthers.	B_C0
We can makelaw to make sure they will not be hurted by the man who do not have a good purpose.	I_C0
And we can give people some reward to absorb them to help others.	E_C0
 
It's kind of funny to watch how my family members make dicisions on purchasing things.	B_I0
Once my younger susion bought a piece of shirt with a famous brand, I wondered about his reasoning and I was told that he wanted it becasue his favorite athlete thought it looks cool.	I_I0
In the same week, I found out that my sister got a set of expensive comestics, which was recommended by a popular Korean singer on a reality show.	E_I0
However, my parents would never do such a thing, they tend to be more rational when buying any product.	S_M1
What's more, for my grandmother, I almost never seen her spend much money on stuff rather than daily necessaries.	B_S1
To this point, I have to say that the older people are more practical and less likely to be influenced by opinions of celebrities than the youngsters.	E_S1
There are few reasons I could think of to explain why younge people are easiler to be influenced by the opinions of celebrities.	S_M1
First, comparing to the older people, teenagers and college students are still at the stage of learning and forming their own personalities.	B_S0
It's normal for them to find idols and admire certain characteristics that they may not have, so that they could gain experiences and find out who they want to become in the furture.	I_S0
Second, old people like our parents and grandparents, they have much more life experiences than us, and tend to get what they can afford, not what others think what is good for them.	E_S0
As a youngster, although some advices from celebrities may be benefitial for us, we should listen to sugegstions from the elders as well, which can actually help us to make rational choices, without being mislead.	S_C2
 
Many parent say to their child they need to listent to their teacher  don't listent to their friend, but a disagree with them.	B_T1
I think student are more influenced by their friends than by their teachers.	E_T1
First, students always play with their friend and when they go to school they can meet their friend.	S_M1
Because they alway see them and have a lot of communicat with their friend, they will tell all their happy things or bad things to their friend, they didn't have any problems with their communication.	B_S0
And they will listen most of the thing to their.	I_S0
For an example in my school if one student he or she get a very good grade other people will start to work hard, becuase they willthink if my friends have a good grade I want to same with them.	I_S0
That why students are more influenced by their friend than teacher.	E_S0
I disagree students are more influenced by their teacher than by their friends because if some students don't like their teacher they will not listent all the things that teacher say.	S_M1
Also  many students think teacher is teacher he or she will not change to be our friend to talke with us, becuse they think theacher is very murder and sometimes teacher will hit student.	B_S0
Let students have fear with their teacher.	I_S0
That why I disagree students are more influenced by their teachers than by their friends.	E_S0
The students influenced by their friends because they are same age, so they have a same mind, but teacher is older than student and they will think teacher will always talk about their grade ,and they just like the student that have good grade, they will not know how about other students thinking.	S_C2
So if parent want to teach their child some things, tall to their friends they know them best!	S_S2
 
Teenagers in the present are always think about making a living without their parents.	B_I0
And toward this phenomenon, different people hold different ideas, some people think that young people nowadays are too dependent.	E_I0
But in my view young people are having better chances to make decisions by themselves.	S_T0
Firstly, people in the current we have a opener societies than before.	S_M0
Open societies means that we don't have so much limitation and can have a free mind and speak anything free.	B_S0
In the contrary that, people in the past have a close societies and maybe the societies are control by the church and if you say something you might get caught.	I_S0
In China 1960s, we have a campaign which limit knoledges and people can't study by destroying the schools.	I_S0
My grandparents can't say anything except words to praise president Mao.	I_S0
However all things changes in the presents since we can do a lot of things that we can't do in the old days.	I_S0
We have a better education system and we can dream a lot of things.	E_S0
Secondly, transportation make a lot of things possible that we can't do it in ancient times.	S_M0
People live in the present are really lucky since everything is really convenient present.	B_S0
The invention of internet really increase the speed of information transport and the invention of cars and trains make people come together easier.	I_S0
We can make a choice after we see something.	I_S0
Once I went out with my grandpa, we talked about what they can do in the past to travel.	I_S0
He said that the farthest distance he ever go is to enter the big city next to his town, but we can go anywhere in the  present days.	I_S0
We can even cross the Pacific Ocean over night.	I_S0
I imagine that I can go overseas and make a choice where I wanted to stay in the rest of my life.	E_S0
Third, the education we can gain in the present are far better than the ancient people.	S_M0
Maybe in the past there are farther less schools, and a lot of people can't learn anything who are remain illeterate during the rest of their life, moreover, they have no choice about what they can do.	B_S0
My uncle is a farmer, he said that when he was a child, the school is really far from his town, and his parents also could't afford the cost of his study.	I_S0
He regreted that he couldn't enter the school to study having no choice except to become a farmer.	I_S0
He now has low income and is looked down by  other people who can have a good job.	I_S0
I think this also remind us about the importance of studying.	E_S0
In sammary, people these days have more opportunities to make choice by themselves, since we have a opener societies, transmissions are more convenient and education rate is h	S_C2
 
In my opinon, i disagree with the point of view that watching a movie or reading a book is better than doing physical exercise .	B_T0
there are three reasons to support my view.	E_T0
Firstly, doing physical execise has something with people's physical, but watching a moive or reading a book is connected with one's mental.	S_M0
there have different work for people to relax.	B_S0
for instance, if you prefer to physical exercise, your body may have a rest.	I_S0
if you chose a movie or a book,your mental will be comfortable.	E_S0
moreover,  different people have different provicion with thierself.	S_M0
for a long time to working,sometimes your body is tired, and somtimes your mental will boring.	B_S1
people who major about  people's force  , prefer to chose  a movie or a book; who work with knowlengeable, doing physical execise is better.	E_S1
finally, the statement is too definety.	S_M0
if someone want to have a relax ,there may have a trip.	B_S0
during the trip, watching a movie ,reading a book or doing physical exercise is all in the list which we can relax.	I_S0
for example ,when you have a enough time ,doing interesting exercise may make you feel relax qucikly; on the  other hand , a book or a movie may slowly relax.	E_S0
 
Parents education is essential for children,and nowadays there still consist of conflcits about parents appproch to educated their children.	B_I0
Some parents hold the view that their child should make some mistakes,  it have benificts to their child learn from their own mistakes .	I_I0
Others parents disagree about this behavior they thought children didn't have ability to face their corrects the best way to their child is to avoid mistake.	I_I0
As far as I'm concerned, I suggest parents let their chilfren make miastakes.	E_I0
The following statements can prove my perspective.	S_T1
Firstly, teenagers have their own thoughts about everthing.	S_M1
They are longed to everthing are going like what they thought about.	B_S0
Actually, it's imposible.	I_S0
Parents want to guide their kids in their approch to make them more proper behavior.	I_S0
But in this time if parents change thier mind to let their child to face their mistakes,it will gain more benifits.	I_S0
Children can get known about their own mistakes, and in this time parents guide them to face their problems contribute to the youngers learn from their own mistakes.	E_S0
Moreover, parents can not help their chid in everything.	S_M1
Parents education meaning lead to their chidren have ablity to face their difficulties.	B_S0
And have possitive view about their faliures,the more posstive view after their mistakes the more possinle teenager wouln't  made mistakes in the same areas.	I_S0
Many children would upset afer they make mistakes,but how to make the teenagers realize their erros and correct the misakes is more important.	I_S0
I once have a very bad habbit like didn't finish the homework ontime.	I_S0
You kown,teenagers have quantity of alleas, and I spent my time on watching TV when ishould do my  homework.	E_S0
My parents once said ''you can do everthing you want in weekend after you finish your work at school''I didn't take it seriously, so at school day, my	O
 
Nowadays,more and more students can get money or gift for their work in school.	B_T1
It is true that these students can get higher mark because of gifts.	E_T1
However I still think students should not receive money even if they can get high grade.	S_T0
Firstly,I think the motivation of study should not be money.	S_M1
If parents give their children money,students may study harder than before.	B_S0
But what students think is 'I will get money if I learn well'.	I_S0
Many classmates in my class can get different kinds 'gift',such as phones,money or even get permission to pay games.	I_S0
After these students get money for many times,what they focus on is what they get but not knowledge.	I_S0
That is really bad for students.	I_S0
After they graduate,what can they get from parents?	I_S0
They may be not willing to get more knowledge, so they cannot improve.	E_S0
Moreover,receive money can make students feel money is easy to make.	S_M1
Because students who can get money by study hard might think their parents have much money.	B_S0
So they can't realize what their parents had done for the family.	I_S0
In the future,these student may not work hard enough to make money but spend so much money.	I_S0
That can be really bad effect on students.	E_S0
So my opinion is that parents need to stop offering their children money eveni	O
 
Taking a relax is neccessary when we feel tired or just finish some works.	B_T1
Doing physical exercise is not a bad way to relax, but in daily life, I would prefer to watching a movie or reading a book to relax.	E_T1
I dislike to choose the physical exercise for relaxing for the reason that even if your spirit could be relaxed and you would be fresh when you take a shower after doing sports, we will still feel tired since your body would not take a break during physical exercise.	S_M1
Moreover, doing physical exercise may make your body more tired probably.	B_S0
Once your body does not get a good relax, you can not fully focus on your next work.	I_S0
So doing physical exercise would only make you spirit feel relax but not good for your body relaxing.	E_S0
However, when I read some books or watching movies in my spare time, I will totally get relax because I do not need my body to do anything and my spirit would focus on something which are fresh and attractive to me.	S_M1
Such as the the movie called Detective Chinatown that I saw last week.	B_S0
This movie was really interesting to me because it is a detective movie with with a lot of humors.	I_S0
After laughing and guessing the storyline time to time, I immersed myself in the story without any tenssion or stress in daily life.	I_S0
After watching the movie or reading the book, I would like to think about something that will happend after the storyline, but my spirit still relax since my sipirit take some fresh things in my brain, then I can fully concentrate on my work.	E_S0
 
Never before in the history has the problem of education been such salient than today.	S_I0
Since people treat education much more important,parents are likely to create some new methods to encourge their children to become more passionate about study.	S_T0
Recently,the phenomenon that parents give thier children money as a reward for getting good marks in school.	S_T1
Some people indicated that it will change children opinion on study,marking them believe only money is the purpose of  the study.	S_T0
However,I conted that giving some money to children as a reward is a good way.a good way that  its merits weigh out its drawback.	S_S2
To start  with,giving money to the children as a reward can stimulate children to study  harder.	S_M2
when children fet feedback of thier hard work,the study will become a happy job instead of a boring job.	B_S0
We can not refute that sometimes study is a very boring things doing a lot of things,reading lots of passagea,working out math problems.	I_S0
So setting a goal for children is necessary for the kids to keep interests.	I_S0
if they could use the money what they wants to buy they must be very happy.	E_S0
All in all,it is a good way to help kids to study and i hope many parents can konw this way to help thier chidren study well.	B_C0
The goal we expect is to encourege our children and tell them to pursue more success.	I_C0
However,if we mkae sure that children will not understand the reward of this things and keep a healthy attitude to the moey.	I_C0
It will be fine to do so.	E_C0
I think this is really a good idea for keep our children to keep thier interests and healthy attitidue to the study.	S_S2
 
Some parents may offer their schoole-age children money when they get a high grad(mark).	B_T0
Some people agree, becasue they think it can encourage students study more hard.	I_T0
However, I think it's a not good way.	E_T0
The most important reason is that when money is connected with knowledge, something is different.	S_M0
It will make students to get a high scores in any ways.	B_S0
We all know the story that students who want to get a higher scores cheat in eaxms.	I_S0
The reasons for a high scores is various, get money should be one of them.	I_S0
Obviously, if students who will get money by a high scores don't get true indications, they will progressively get bad and finally cheat or do more harmful things.	E_S0
The second, little students don't have a completable sense of value, they don't know what the money means.	S_M0
They may be make money abused or to push themselves into something harmful.	B_S0
A good sense of value may take some time to form.	I_S0
Students in school don't have the phenomenon to form it and the main purpose for them is studying.	I_S0
So, it is dangerous to give students money.	E_S0
Thirdly, schildren who get money from parents will get his/her students jealous of.	S_M0
It may come into a bad phenomenon.	B_S0
That each one in class want get money from their parents.	I_S0
Apprently, the result is each one study for money and will laugh at ones who have a bad grades.	I_S0
That's horrible.	E_S0
Nevertheless, I don't mean that the money for a high grade is always bad.	S_M0
I think parents should always guide their students, espically they get a large amount of money.	B_S1
But not every parents will have time to do it or realize to do it.	E_S1
All in all, it is not a good idea, I hope students should study purely, not for money.	S_C2
 
As many experts say, doing exercises helps release body stressures, fix physical problems, leading to a healthy body, soul and mind.	B_I0
However, there are lots of people tend to seek mental enjoyment.	I_I0
They would prefor watching movies or reading books during theri relax time.	E_I0
In my opinion, taking physical exercise is more benifical.	S_T0
To begin with, doing exercises can offer many benifits to one's physical processes.	S_M0
When doing physical activities, the blood flow and muscles moves, while watching television or reading a book won't cost lots of energy.	B_S0
Lack of exercises often leads to a number of health problems, such as high blood pressure, heart diseases and obesity.	I_S0
If one wants to get turly relax, he must possess a healthy body, and this has to be achieved by physical activities like jogging, swiming, playing ball games, mountain climbing, reather sitting in a chair all day long.	E_S0
On top of that, physical exercises can hepl people utilize their leisure time more constructively.	B_M0
Finally, some king of physical exercises can help people encourage socoalization and team building, which can benefit a lot to one's life, makes it a much greater way to relax than sitting alone.	E_M0
For instance, sports like basketball and soccer, which include many people to jion it.	B_S0
In these sports, people meet and play as a team, share theie happiness ane excitment with each other and as a result achieve much higher levels of enjoyment and satisfication.	I_S0
While watxching movies and reading books alone won't bring us these joyment.	E_S0

Can you imagine what things would like to be if one guy doesn't know a thing about history?	B_I0
Have you ever thought about the consequence of a student who is totally unliterate in history area?	E_I0
These answers should not be really optimistic.	S_T0
Nowadays, there are a lot of things can have something to do with the history including our classes, news, and even in some exams.	S_T1
And if we don't want to be behind others or lack of some knowledge, the best thing to do is trying to get to know more history no matter what knid of study field we are in.	S_S2
Some history are really necessary for students to know anout because some tests contain knowledge about history events.	S_M2
We know the SAT test is real crutial for all of the students who are in senior high and readily to enter a college, then we should know that the SAT tests always have some passages or essays parts about historical policies or soem historical events.	B_S0
This is why students have the necessity to have classes about history, studying hostory can help them to solve those questions faster and easier because we know that the time of the test parts are too limited to us to complete.	I_S0
So this can help students save a bunch of time instead of reading a complex and sophisticated passage about history for a student who is totally ignorant to history.	E_S0
On the other hand, we should know that the knowedge of history is filled in our simple lives, and we need them to understand what some news about history things.	S_C2
Few things can be more insane than being ignorant to history in our daily lives.	B_S0
When we are watching some news on TV, then a history argument appears which causes a sensational event recently but u don't know it, which means that you are living in a awareless world when others are talking about this kind of events in front of you.	I_S0
Above these, it tells usevery single of us should know the basic history at least.	E_S0
 
Family members do play an important role in out life, but if we really need a giant extended family can be controversial.	S_T0
Although some people may think that living with their hole family members is a good choice, I believe that because of the great changes in working, living enviroment and internet, an extended family is not as important as it is before.	S_T1
Nowadays friends and bussiness companions become more and more powerful that they making up our social life that familiy members become less important.	S_M1
For most of the people, in a busy working day, they have to work with their cooporaters for eight hours and talking or playing with their friends for more hours.	B_S0
They build an adults' most life.	I_S0
So they do not have time and also do not need to have a giant family to live with.	I_S0
Deal with that kind of family could cost too much time in some cases.	E_S0
Living standards improve very fast that one depends less on relatives than he or she did before.	S_M1
At ancient time the family could be a kind of insurance that if one family members lost job or suffer from a bad ill other members can help he or she to go over it.	B_S0
But at modern time people can deal with most of the situations by them self.	I_S0
An research shows that in China citizens became really rich that if they want to decrease their eating standrad, they can afford the hole years' food by one month's salary.	I_S0
That is not include the money government give to poor people and the medical insurance the government by for most of us.	I_S0
So an extended family became useless in this way.	E_S0
Internet, or in another word, the vitual world, has satisfied much need of every ordinary citizen in modern times.	B_C0
The data of Apple store shows that most of the people install wechat in their phones and over ninty percents of apple smartphone users have at least one message app.	I_C0
These may us able to find and talk with the one we like or even develop a group for the people interested in the same things.	E_C0
Now it is the time that interact with people that is interesting become really easy.	B_S0
And all of us can find resources in the internet to cover the need of entertainment and satisfiction.	I_S0
So family are not as important as ancient time.	E_S0
 
Nowadays, there are more outstanding and excellent people in various of fields and they pursue challeged works to develop  their ability and gain experience to achieve their goal.	B_I0
That is what most people said "success".	E_I0
However, some people prefer the ease and convenient work to have a comfortable and stable living.	S_T1
That is ture, different people have individual prusue and need.	S_T0
From my perspective, the challenge would stimulate people's ambitous and promote the living quality in one's life	S_T1
Different types of tasks during the workday means you are able to meet fresh things and you can obersve unique and beautiful scenes in tasks.	S_M1
When i was a little girl, my mother would ask me to do some interesiting task after the school, such as having a draw and flowering.	B_S1
I felt interesting and curious to finish the tasks and enjoyed my childhood.	E_S1
When you have various assignments to do during the workdays.	S_M1
you will ask for some problems you do not understand from other professors so that you could learn something different and available.	B_S0
When i was a freshman in college, i participates in several communities.	I_S0
It is my responsibility to do many different tasks to finish my work.	I_S0
When i had problems in task, i would ask some professors and acquire some availabe information and gain knowlege fand experience.	E_S0
Undoubtedly, do similar tasks all day long is comfortable and relax for some people.	B_C1
It is easy to have a bad habit to think less and feel bored about the tasks.	E_C1
 
Some parents offer their school-age children money for each high grade,differeft people have diffierent openion on this peoblem.	S_I0
But in my openion I think it's a good idea to do this.	S_T0
Because the money is a kind of award to the children's hard working, in this way children will show more passion on learning, and expect to get good grade next time.	S_M2
And the money he earnd will let the children know that the money is not easy to earn, which is good to give him a correct attitude to money and to cultivate a good habit of thrift.	B_S0
Much more, children work hard to get the money, it just like the payment when the children get into work, this "payment" educate the chileren that if you eork hard and get good gread ,then you will get your payment.	I_S0
It can built a right openion of work and pay.	I_S0
We are always want to seprate the childhood and the adulthood.	I_S0
And many people want to keep children from the adult's work, which may cause the problen that some children don't know the hardship of thire parents and when they grow up they may have no idea on how to adapt to it.	E_S0
tosumupI think it's a good idea to give children money as a award when they get good grade in the school.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, some parents will give their children some money as a reward of their high marks.	S_I0
They think it is an effective way to stimulate their children to study hard and get improved.	S_T0
However, in my opinion, offering money as a reward is just a temporate way for children to get improved.	S_M0
What's more, it is actually a wrong method for parents to educate their children.	S_S2
Firstly, I think, as a school-age children, they don't need too much money to spend at all.	S_M0
Parents will support their basic costing such as food, clothes and tuition.	B_S1
Most of their sparing time will be spent in house or schools.	E_S1
Secondly, I think this method will affect their attitude towards money.	S_M0
They will treat money rather than getting knowledge or create some value as their motivition of studying.	B_S0
Last but not the least, I think studying is our own thing.	I_S0
It's something that we ourselves should pay some effort.	I_S0
We should realize that only yourself have decided to study very hard, will you get a lasting motivation of studying.	I_S0
Acutually this is the important key to get an excellent grades.	E_S0
For most of the students, maybe they all want to get some rewards after geting high marks and making their parents satistified.	S_M0
Getting some rewards does could make children feel happy and want to study harder to keep a good grade.	B_S0
However, what we should know is that offering a reward is a good thing.	I_S0
But giving money is a wrong choice.	I_S0
It's too lazy for those parents to educate their children.	I_S0
They will think that money is everything.	E_S0
Therefore, as far as I am concerned, I suggest that parents can organize a camping as a reward to their children.	B_C0
Use some spare time to have fun with families and spend time to play with your children.	I_C0
Through this way, children will feel the important of their family.	E_C0
 
In my personally opinion,I don't think it's a good idea for parents tooffer the school-age children money for each high grade.	B_T0
Because the school-aged children don't have enough experience for how to use money.	E_T0
What ‘s more,this behavior can also help children developing a bad habit that they will always depend on parents and ask them for more money when they have used out of their money.	S_T1
For example ,one of my classmates whose parents always gave him a lot of monry when he was at school always used a lot of money for the e-business and bought  a lot of unuseful things.	S_M2
Unluckily,one day, he has been cheated by someone on line which led to him lost all his monry.	B_S0
This thing it is all because of his lack of assets management experience and his parents always giving him too much money.	I_S0
So I don't agree that the parents give too much money to the school-age children,maybe someone could say it can teach the children how to manage their own money.	I_S0
But what I can say is that the only task of children is studying knowledge instead of how to use money.	I_S0
If the parents want to teach them or practice their experience, they should teach them when they go to the university.	I_S0
The university is the only place where you can learn a lot of life skills.	E_S0
In one word,the school-age children don't need a lot of money,so the parents also should know this point.	S_C2
 
Nowadays, young people are trying to control their own lives in the unstable morden society.	B_I0
They are trying to take careers they want or they are interested in.	E_I0
And because of this phenominan, I believed that young people today are better able to make decisions about their own lives than the teenagers in the past.	S_T0
It's undeniable that parents these days are so open to the world.	S_M1
In today's society, goveronment has told the parents these days to honour their kid's own idea and plan for a really long time, also parents' own experience told themselves that the interest is the best teacher and will lead the teenagers to a better future.	B_S0
Take my mom as an example, she has been inspaired me to find what I can devote my whole life to since I was a little baby.	I_S0
My mom really doesn't like her career she takes now, which is work as an acountant, and wanted to be a doctor from a young age.	I_S0
But at that time, her parents, who is my grandparents, didn't allow her to achieve her goal.	I_S0
So she really understands how it feel if a child is limited by his or her parents.	I_S0
Also, the TV show today influenced her and she determined to do what she was told by TV.	E_S0
In addition, the progress of morden society allows teens to chose what they want to be in the future.	S_M1
In old days, parents were quite worried about if their children could earn his or her life because of the poor resources in sociey.	B_S0
So to make sure their children were able to live better, they will plan their children's lives and didn't allow the children themselves to make their decision.	I_S0
But now adays, the good governments will make sure we can at least live in this society, so we can do what we want to do instead of limited by our safty of life.	I_S0
Just like when it was 1978 in China, it was quite usual that teenagers' parents determined the marriage between two lovers, and it was a common situation that the marriage of two people was canceled by their parents.	I_S0
But all the things are different now.	I_S0
We do have our own freedom to choose our huspand or wife.	I_S0
What we need to do is well communicated with our parents.	E_S0
I really sense a lot of freedom we might don't have in the past today.	S_C2
Since our parents have been much more open-minded, they also have given us rights to choose our own lives.	S_S2
 
Maybe a lot of people will dissagree this statement.	B_I0
Because in their mind, yong people always depended other thing to do something.	I_I0
Depended their parents, depended their firiends, all in all they never do somgthing by themself.	E_I0
Yeah, that is right, but now, just have a little people are very lazy.	S_T0
So many yong people are very independent.	S_T1
So i agree this statement.	S_T0
First, the compete is more and more stronger in the socialty.	S_M1
If you are still very lazy, do anything want to get other people's help.	B_S0
You will become lower in the socialty.	I_S0
However if you are very independent, you will have a lot of graet hobbies.	I_S0
Because these great hobbies you will become a talent in the socialty.	I_S0
For example, my brother Roy , he is working in a big company.	I_S0
He is not smart, is not handsome, but he is very independent, when he was young, his things always do by himself.	I_S0
When his parents want to help him, he tell his parents'' This is my thing, please let me do by myself.''	I_S0
So now he is successful because of his independent.	E_S0
Second, in the past, maybe have so many parents like to help their kinds, but now!	S_M1
That is parents are become grandparents, and that is kind is become parents.	B_S0
Because when they was yong, their parents like to help them anything, so that they did not very independent.	I_S0
So for their kinds that parents not help their kind so much.	I_S0
So their kinds will more independent than their parents.	I_S0
Such as my sister Alice, his grandparents like help her when they meet her , but her parents are not.	I_S0
Only when Alice have some problem that she cannot solve it by herslef, her parents will help her.	E_S0
When these kind grow up become a yong person, they always are better able to make decisions about their own lives.	B_C1
Therefore i agree this statement.	E_C1
 
Some may agree that colorful job is more enjoyable than a job just with black and white.	S_T1
others may advocate that the job  's tasks are as simple as better.	S_T0
In my mind, I want to choose a job that focus on just one types of tasks.	S_T1
First, doing one similar tasks means you practice your one single ability every workdays, with that practice, you will be very good at that.	S_M0
Otherwise, you do planty of different jobs every day, though you know how to do various different tasks, you can not just focus on just one point.	B_S1
Comparing these two different types, you will be more effient if you just focus on just one things, in other word, you will spent less time in doing the same workload.	E_S1
Second, with different tasks, you have to spent a lot of time to learn, to hand on.	S_M0
But for only one similar job, you just need to study for just one time, and constantly enhance your ability during your work.	B_S1
your time spent on studting is less and you can do your job in a shorter time.	E_S1
For example, many famous people just focus on just one tasks thay do, when they do it better than others do, they achieved.	S_M0
Like steven jobs, he just focus on how to make a great phone, after many years, he finally did it with the help of his Apple.	B_S1
For the reason why he succeeded, in my opinion, he just pay his all attention in his simple but difficult job, so he can do his best.	E_S1
Usually, people all have very strong ability to do want they can do.	B_C0
But whether they can succeed depend on how much the attention they pay to the task.	I_C0
If the task is various, each tasks will only have just a little attention, while it is just one tasks, people can devote themselves all to the task, so they will be success and live a good life.	E_C0
 
Nowadays,several parents give their school-age kids pocket money for each high grade they get in school.	B_I0
From  my oppinion,I do not believe that it is a goog idea to do this.	E_I0
In  the following paragraphs,I have three reasons to support my oppinion.	S_T0
Firstly,I hold the view that parents are not supposed to give their children more money than they should have.	S_M0
Children at school-age are too young to advocate their money.	B_S1
They do not have the ability to put their pocket money into good use,or to say,they cannot use the money correctly.	E_S1
Secondly,I do not think it is appropriate to let their kids to have money if they do good in their study,Some kids will be satisfied with the gift but some are not.	S_M0
Some children will think of a lot of methods to earn the money,such as copy or cheat in the exam,it will build a bad habbit and do harm to the development of these children.	B_S1
It can not only do bad to their study but also their personal quality.	E_S1
Thirdly,I think it is a good approach to let them build a good habbit of saving money if parents won't let their school-age children have that so much money.	S_M0
Saving money is a good personal quality that every people should have,So it will be benifitial to let the school-age kids build such good quality from a young age.	B_S1
I will help them to have a good mind to use money correctly.	E_S1
From what have been mentioned above,we can draw the conclution that it is necessary to not let parents offer their school-age children monry for each high grade they get in shool.	B_C1
Children should be given recognition if they do good at school and get good grades,but they are not suggested to be given money.	E_C1
 
Life is always difficult and the hardship appears in different aspects under different backgrounds.	B_I0
For our grandparents, people had to strive for raising several children with thin income.	E_I0
Nowdays, we have to keep track with the high pace of the society.	S_M1
In the past year, the food was inadequate and the salary was low.	B_S0
In order to cultivate several children, adults had to find additional work to make up thin payment.	I_S0
The huge pressure from living drove them to eat and wear simply.	I_S0
I was often told tha  my grandparents merely had rice for dinner without any vegetables, let alone meat.	I_S0
To reduce the burden of their families, our grandparents went to work earlier, some of them were even immature.	I_S0
When they received money, they did nothing but to make an informed arrangement on how to spend it.	I_S0
For example, the daily necessities, the electronic bill, phone bill and the tuition of younger kids were all needed to be taken into acconut.	I_S0
That is why they seldom bought  themselves new clothes and had some entertainment.	E_S0
Furthermore, in most families, the younger children had to wear the clothes from their brothers and sisters only because they could not afford the new ones.	S_M1
At that time, grandparents had no choices but to squeeze the expense every day for the preparation for the new year.	B_S0
It was their effort that resulted in our relative happier life today.	I_S0
However, nowdays we also have to face infinite stress from the highly developed society.	E_S0
Admittedly, we are not that poor as our grandparents, yet tghe diffculties of our age never fade next to theirs.	B_C0
Actually, the fierce competition provides us with narrowchance to escape but to work hard, even harder than our           grandparents.	I_C0
In spite of the pressure physically, we are confronted with the mental problems.	E_C0
Children have to bear the constant expectation from their parents and school and th	O
 
Nowadays , more and more young people  are independent.	S_I0
Such as they could make the decision by themselves rather than depend on parents.	B_T0
Some people would think it is not a good idea, but, in my opinion, I support this matter.	E_T0
admittedly, when young people listen to their parents a lot, they can avoid a lot of mistakes.	S_M0
Such as, if parents tell them that you should go to the summer class, then they would improve a lot in the summer vacation, and they will also have a happy ending after listening to the parents.	B_S0
However, this situation most happens in the past.	I_S0
Nowadays matter has chaged.	E_S0
Firstly, these centraies, young people could make more sensiable decision than their parents becaus ethey have more knowledge.	S_M0
Now the high tecnology have boosted a lot, so even people stay at home all the time, they also could kow the matter which happens around the world.	B_S0
and after learning these information, young peopel would have more knowledge.	I_S0
So they would know which decision is better for themselves and which one is harmful.	I_S0
For example, one of my friends got a call, and it told him that he can get fifity thousands as long as he gave one hundrend to a bank card.	I_S0
His parents think it is a good idea because they could have soem extra money.	I_S0
Then my friend told his parents that he has read this news befor on the internet, and this matter came from a lier.	E_S0
Secondly, young people should make soem mistakes by themselves then they can learn from it.	S_M0
Some knowlege needs peopel make a lot of error than they can record it next time, no matter how many times other people tell them.	B_S0
And onlt really remember the mistake people can avoid something more serious and dangrous.	I_S0
Lmy sister loves taking the bike so much, especially ride it from very high hill.	I_S0
her parents told her it is very dangrous bt she didn't listen to them.	I_S0
Untile last time she fell down from the bicycle and broke the legs, she promised that h\she would never do it again.	I_S0
But she still lied down and had a rest in the hopitail for a whole month and she also missed my birthday party.	I_S0
But at this time, she really followed her promise very well.	I_S0
And she didn't do the dangrous thing like that tiem again.	E_S0
All in all it is good for young people to listen to themselves.	B_C1
It not only can avoild something which their parents don't know enterily, but it also can avoid next error.	E_C1
